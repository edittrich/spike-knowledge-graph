    "## LLM Graph Transformer\n",
    "The LLM Graph Transformer was designed to provide a flexible framework for building graphs using any LLM. With so many different providers and models available, this task is far from simple. Fortunately, LangChain steps in to handle much of the standardization process. As for the LLM Graph Transformer itself, it's like two cats stacked in a trench coat -with the ability to operate in two completely independent modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2400/1*aCSCXuvrOB90jRQ0mNZtSA.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The LLM Graph Transformer operates in two distinct modes, each designed to generate graphs from documents using an LLM in different scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tool-Based Mode (Default)**: When the LLM supports structured output or function calling, this mode leverages the LLM's built-in with_structured_outputto use tools. The tool specification defines the output format, ensuring that entities and relationships are extracted in a structured, predefined manner. This is depicted on the left side of the image, where code for the Node and Relationship classes is shown.\n",
    "* **Prompt-Based Mode (Fallback)** : In situations where the LLM doesn't support tools or function calls, the LLM Graph Transformer falls back to a purely prompt-driven approach. This mode uses few-shot prompting to define the output format, guiding the LLM to extract entities and relationships in a text-based manner. The results are then parsed through a custom function, which converts the LLM's output into a JSON format. This JSON is used to populate nodes and relationships, just as in the tool-based mode, but here the LLM is guided entirely by prompting rather than structured tools. This is shown on the right side of the image, where an example prompt and resulting JSON output are provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two modes ensure that the LLM Graph Transformer is adaptable to different LLMs, allowing it to build graphs either directly using tools or by parsing output from a text-based prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note that you can use prompt-based extraction even with models that support tools/functions by setting the attribute ignore_tools_usage=True._\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tool-based extraction\n",
    "We initially chose a tool-based approach for extraction since it minimized the need for extensive prompt engineering and custom parsing functions. In LangChain, the with_structured_output method allows you to extract information using tools or functions, with output defined either through a JSON structure or a Pydantic object. Personally, I find Pydantic objects clearer, so we opted for that.\n",
    "We start by defining a Node class.\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Node(BaseNode):\n",
    "    id: str = Field(..., description=\"Name or human-readable unique identifier\")\n",
    "    label: str = Field(..., description=f\"Available options are {enum_values}\")\n",
    "    properties: Optional[List[Property]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each node has an id, a label, and optional properties. For brevity, I haven't included full descriptions here. Describing ids as human-readable unique identifier is important since some LLMs tend to understand ID properties in more traditional way like random strings or incremental integers. Instead we want the name of entities to be used as id property. We also limit the available label types by simply listing them in the labeldescription. Additionally, LLMs like OpenAI's, support an enum parameter, which we also use.\n",
    "Next, we take a look at the Relationship class\n",
    "```\n",
    "class Relationship(BaseRelationship):\n",
    "    source_node_id: str\n",
    "    source_node_label: str = Field(..., description=f\"Available options are {enum_values}\")\n",
    "    target_node_id: str\n",
    "    target_node_label: str = Field(..., description=f\"Available options are {enum_values}\")\n",
    "    type: str = Field(..., description=f\"Available options are {enum_values}\")\n",
    "    properties: Optional[List[Property]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is the second iteration of the Relationship class. Initially, we used a nested Node object for the source and target nodes, but we quickly found that nested objects reduced the accuracy and quality of the extraction process. So, we decided to flatten the source and target nodes into separate fields-for example, source_node_id and source_node_label, along with target_node_id and target_node_label. Additionally, we define the allowed values in the descriptions for node labels and relationship types to ensure the LLMs adhere to the specified graph schema.\n",
    "The tool-based extraction approach enables us to define properties for both nodes and relationships. Below is the class we used to define them.\n",
    "class Property(BaseModel):\n",
    "    \"\"\"A single property consisting of key and value\"\"\"\n",
    "    key: str = Field(..., description=f\"Available options are {enum_values}\")\n",
    "    value: str\n",
    "Each Property is defined as a key-value pair. While this approach is flexible, it has its limitations. For instance, we can't provide a unique description for each property, nor can we specify certain properties as mandatory while others optional, so all properties are defined as optional. Additionally, properties aren't defined individually for each node or relationship type but are instead shared across all of them.\n",
    "We've also implemented a detailed system prompt to help guide the extraction. In my experience, though, the function and argument descriptions tend to have a greater impact than the system message.\n",
    "Unfortunately, at the moment, there is no simple way to customize function or argument descriptions in LLM Graph Transformer.\n",
    "## Prompt-based extraction\n",
    "Since only a few commercial LLMs and LLaMA 3 support native tools, we implemented a fallback for models without tool support. You can also set ignore_tool_usage=True to switch to a prompt-based approach even when using a model that supports tools.\n",
    "Most of the prompt engineering and examples for the prompt-based approach were contributed by Geraldus Wilsen.\n",
    "With the prompt-based approach, we have to define the output structure directly in the prompt. You can find the whole prompt here. In this blog post, we'll just do a high-level overview. We start by defining the system prompt.\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph. Your task is to identify the entities and relations specified in the user prompt from a given text and produce the output in JSON format. This output should be a list of JSON objects, with each object containing the following keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"head\"**: The text of the extracted entity, which must match one of the types specified in the user prompt.\n",
    "- **\"head_type\"**: The type of the extracted head entity, selected from the specified list of types.\n",
    "- **\"relation\"**: The type of relation between the \"head\" and the \"tail,\" chosen from the list of allowed relations.\n",
    "- **\"tail\"**: The text of the entity representing the tail of the relation.\n",
    "- **\"tail_type\"**: The type of the tail entity, also selected from the provided list of types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract as many entities and relationships as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Entity Consistency**: Ensure consistency in entity representation. If an entity, like \"John Doe,\" appears multiple times in the text under different names or pronouns (e.g., \"Joe,\" \"he\"), use the most complete identifier consistently. This consistency is essential for creating a coherent and easily understandable knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Notes**:\n",
    "- Do not add any extra explanations or text.\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the prompt-based approach, a key difference is that we ask the LLM to extract only relationships, not individual nodes. This means we won't have any isolated nodes, unlike with the tool-based approach. Additionally, because models lacking native tool support typically perform worse, we do not allow extraction any properties - whether for nodes or relationships, to keep the extraction output simpler.\n",
    "Next, we add a couple of few-shot examples to the model.\n",
    "```\n",
    "examples = [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"text\": (\n",
    "            \"Adam is a software engineer in Microsoft since 2009, \"\n",
    "            \"and last year he got an award as the Best Talent\"\n",
    "        ),\n",
    "        \"head\": \"Adam\",\n",
    "        \"head_type\": \"Person\",\n",
    "        \"relation\": \"WORKS_FOR\",\n",
    "        \"tail\": \"Microsoft\",\n",
    "        \"tail_type\": \"Company\",\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    {\n",
    "        \"text\": (\n",
    "            \"Adam is a software engineer in Microsoft since 2009, \"\n",
    "            \"and last year he got an award as the Best Talent\"\n",
    "        ),\n",
    "        \"head\": \"Adam\",\n",
    "        \"head_type\": \"Person\",\n",
    "        \"relation\": \"HAS_AWARD\",\n",
    "        \"tail\": \"Best Talent\",\n",
    "        \"tail_type\": \"Award\",\n",
    "    },\n",
    "...\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this approach, there's currently no support for adding custom few-shot examples or extra instructions. The only way to customize is by modifying the entire prompt through the promptattribute. Expanding customization options is something we're actively considering.\n",
    "Next, we'll take a look at defining the graph schema.\n",
    "## Defining the graph schema\n",
    "When using the LLM Graph Transformer for information extraction, defining a graph schema is essential for guiding the model to build meaningful and structured knowledge representations. A well-defined graph schema specifies the types of nodes and relationships to be extracted, along with any attributes associated with each. This schema serves as a blueprint, ensuring that the LLM consistently extracts relevant information in a way that aligns with the desired knowledge graph structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post, we'll use the opening paragraph of Marie Curie's Wikipedia page for testing with an added sentence at the end about Robin Williams."

    "# Building knowledge graphs with LLM Graph Transformer\n",
    "## A deep dive into LangChain's implementation of graph construction with LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating graphs from text is incredibly exciting, but definitely challenging. Essentially, it's about converting unstructured text into structured data. While this approach has been around for some time, it gained significant traction with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), bringing it more into the mainstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*qgT2hBiA3DA1Y3qu.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image above, you can see how information extraction transforms raw text into a knowledge graph. On the left, multiple documents show unstructured sentences about individuals and their relationships with companies. On the right, this same information is represented as a graph of entities and their connections, showing who worked at or founded various organizations.\n",
    "But why would you want to extract structured information from text and represent it as a graph? One key reason is to power retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications. While using text embedding models over unstructured text is an useful approach, it can fall short when it comes to answering complex, multi-hop questions that require understanding connections across multiple entities or question where structured operations like filtering, sorting, and aggregation is required. By extracting structured information from text and constructing knowledge graphs, you not only organize data more effectively but also create a powerful framework for understanding complex relationships between entities. This structured approach makes it much easier to retrieve and leverage specific information, expanding the types of questions you can answer while providing greater accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Around a year ago, I began experimenting with building graphs using LLMs, and due to the growing interest, we decided to integrate this capability into LangChain as the LLM Graph Transformer. Over the past year, we've gained valuable insights and introduced new features, which we'll be showcasing in this blog post.\n",

Zu weiteren\\njeweiligen Bedeutungen siehe Albert Einstein (Begriffsklärung) und\\nEinstein (Begriffsklärung).  Einstein mit Kreide in der Hand vor\\neiner Tafel stehend, auf die er einen Kreidekreis gezeichnet hat,\\nlächelnd, von halblinks, die linke Hand auf dem Pult\\nabstützend Albert Einstein, Fotografie von Ferdinand Schmutzer, 1921\\n Albert Einsteins Unterschrift Albert Einsteins Unterschrift\\nALBERT EINSTEIN (  14. März 1879 in Ulm; † 18. April 1955 in\\nPrinceton, New Jersey, heimatberechtigt ab 1901 in Zürich) war ein\\ntheoretischer Physiker. Er gilt als einer der bedeutendsten Physiker\\nder Wissenschaftsgeschichte und weltweit als einer der bekanntesten\\nWissenschaftler der Neuzeit. Seine Forschungen zur Struktur von\\nMaterie, Raum und Zeit sowie zum Wesen der Gravitation veränderten\\nmaßgeblich das zuvor geltende newtonsche Weltbild. 1999 wurde Albert\\nEinstein in einer durch die Fachzeitschrift Physics World\\ndurchgeführten Umfrage unter führenden Physikern vor Isaac Newton,\\nJames Clerk Maxwell, Niels Bohr und Werner Heisenberg zum\\nbedeutendsten Physiker aller Zeiten gewählt. 1 \\nEinsteins Hauptwerk, die Relativitätstheorie, machte ihn\\nweltberühmt. Im Jahr 1905 erschien seine Arbeit mit dem Titel _Zur\\nElektrodynamik bewegter Körper,_ deren Inhalt heute als Spezielle\\nRelativitätstheorie bezeichnet wird. 1915 publizierte er die\\nAllgemeine Relativitätstheorie. Auch zur Quantenphysik leistete er\\nwesentliche Beiträge. „Für seine Verdienste um die Theoretische\\nPhysik, besonders für seine Entdeckung des Gesetzes des\\nphotoelektrischen Effekts“, erhielt er den Nobelpreis des Jahres\\n1921, der ihm 1922 überreicht wurde. Seine theoretischen Arbeiten\\nspielten – im Gegensatz zur weit verbreiteten Meinung – beim Bau\\nder Atombombe und der Entwicklung der Kernenergie nur eine indirekte\\nRolle. 2 \\nEinstein gilt als Inbegriff des Forschers und Genies. Er nutzte seine\\naußerordentliche Bekanntheit auch außerhalb der\\nnaturwissenschaftlichen Fachwelt bei seinem Einsatz für\\nVölkerverständigung, Frieden und Sozialismus. 3 \\nSTAATSANGEHÖRIGKEITEN\\nIm Laufe seines Lebens war Einstein Staatsbürger mehrerer Staaten:\\nDurch Geburt besaß er – wie seine Eltern – die\\nwürttembergische Staatsbürgerschaft. Von 1896 bis 1901 war er\\nstaatenlos, weil er in Württemberg keinen Militärdienst leisten\\nwollte. Ab 1901 bis zu seinem Tode war er Schweizer, 1911/1912 war er\\naufgrund seiner Tätigkeit in Prag auch Bürger Österreichs. Von 1914\\nbis 1932 lebte er in Berlin und war Bürger Preußens. Angesichts der\\nMachtergreifung Hitlers wünschte Einstein 1933 die Entlassung aus der\\npreußischen Staatsangehörigkeit. Das NS-Regime entsprach diesem\\nWunsch erst 1934 durch eine inzwischen mögliche Ausbürgerung als\\n„schwere entehrende Strafe“, weil er sich „besonders schwer\\ngegen die Volksgemeinschaft vergangen habe“. 4  Im Jahr 1940 erwarb\\ner die Staatsbürgerschaft der Vereinigten Staaten. 5  6 \\nLEBEN\\nKINDHEIT UND JUGEND\\nVORFAHREN UND ELTERNHAUS\\n Hermann Einstein, der Vater von Albert Einstein  \\nHermann Einstein, der Vater von Albert Einstein \\n Pauline Einstein, geb. Koch, die Mutter von Albert Einstein  \\nPauline Einstein, geb. Koch, die Mutter von Albert Einstein \\nDie Eltern Hermann Einstein und Pauline Einstein entstammten\\njüdischen Familien, die schon seit Jahrhunderten im schwäbischen\\nRaum ansässig waren. Die Großeltern mütterlicherseits hatten ihren\\nNachnamen _Dörzbacher_ in _Koch_ geändert; die Großeltern\\nväterlicherseits, Abraham und Hindel (Helene) Einstein, geb. Moos,\\ntrugen noch traditionell jüdische Vornamen. Die Großeltern\\nväterlicherseits zogen um 1870 von Buchau nach Ulm, wo schließlich\\nfünf ihrer sechs Kinder lebten, nur Jakob Einstein nicht. Der von\\nAbraham Einstein ererbte Wohlstand erlaubte Hermann Einstein um 1870\\nden Kauf der Teilhaberschaft der Bettfedernfabrik Israel & Levi im\\nHaus Weinhof 19 in Ulm und damit den Besitz der Hälfte dieses\\nHauses. 7 \\nSein Vater Hermann Einstein stammte aus der oberschwäbischen\\nKleinstadt Buchau, in der es seit dem Mittelalter innerhalb des\\nTerritoriums des freiweltlichen Damenstifts Buchau eine bedeutende\\njüdische Gemeinde gab (siehe auch _Familie Einstein in Bad Buchau_).\\nDer erste namentlich nachgewiesene Vorfahre Albert Einsteins, ein aus\\ndem Bodenseeraum stammender Pferde- und Tuchhändler namens _Baruch\\nMoses Ainstein,_ wurde im 17. Jahrhundert in die Gemeinde\\naufgenommen. 8  Auf den Grabsteinen des Buchauer jüdischen Friedhofs\\nsind noch heute die Namen vieler Verwandter Einsteins zu finden, so\\nauch der des letzten Juden der Stadt, _Siegbert Einstein,_ eines\\nGroßneffen des Physikers, der das KZ Theresienstadt überlebt hatte\\nund zeitweise zweiter Bürgermeister Buchaus war.\\nHermann Einstein übersiedelte mit seinen Brüdern um 1869 nach Ulm.\\nIn Cannstatt bei Stuttgart heiratete er 1876 Pauline Koch. Er lebte\\nmit ihr in Ulm im Haus Bahnhofstraße 20 (B135), wo Albert Einstein\\nam 14. März 1879 zur Welt kam. 9  Albert wuchs in einer\\nassimilierten deutsch-jüdischen Mittelstandsfamilie heran. 10 \\nEinstein schrieb später, kurz nach seinem 50. Geburtstag, an die\\nUlmer Abendpost Folgendes über seine Geburtsstadt:\\n> „Die Stadt der Geburt hängt dem Leben als etwas ebenso\\n> Einzigartiges an wie die Herkunft von der leiblichen Mutter. Auch\\n> der Geburtsstadt verdanken wir einen Teil unseres Wesens. So gedenke\\n> ich Ulm in Dankbarkeit, da es edle künstlerische Tradition mit\\n> schlichter und gesunder Wesensart verbindet.“\\n– 18. März 1929 11 \\nZu seiner in Ulm lebenden, nur wenig älteren Cousine Lina Einstein\\nhielt Albert Einstein den Kontakt. 1940 wurde sie im Alter von 65\\nJahren zwangsweise in das jüdische Altersheim Oberstotzingen\\neingewiesen. Albert Einsteins Versuche, für Lina eine\\nAusreisegenehmigung in die USA zu beschaffen, scheiterten. 1942 wurde\\nLina Einstein in das KZ Theresienstadt deportiert und im selben Jahr\\nim Vernichtungslager Treblinka ermordet. 12 \\nMÜNCHEN UND SCHULAUSBILDUNG BIS 1894\\n Wohnhaus in München\\nDie Familie zog kurz nach der Geburt Alberts 1880 nach München, wo\\nsein Vater und sein Onkel im Oktober 1880 einen kleinen Betrieb zur\\nGas- und Wasserinstallation gründeten. Da dieser wirtschaftlich\\nzufriedenstellend lief, beschlossen sie 1885 und mit Unterstützung\\nder gesamten Familie, eine eigene Fabrik für elektrische Geräte\\n_(Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie)_ ins Leben zu\\nrufen. 13  Das Unternehmen seines Vaters war erfolgreich und\\nbelieferte Kraftwerke in München-Schwabing, Varese und Susa\\n(Italien). 14  Zweieinhalb Jahre nach Albert wurde seine Schwester\\nMaja (  18. November 1881 in München; † 25. Juni 1951 in\\nPrinceton, New Jersey, USA) geboren. Die Familie wohnte im Münchener\\nStadtteil Isarvorstadt, zunächst von 1880 bis 1885 in einer Wohnung\\nan der heutigen Müllerstraße 54, ab 1885 auf dem Grundstück, das\\nsich heute zwischen Adlzreiterstraße 12 15  und Lindwurmstraße 127\\nerstreckt. Zu seiner jüngeren Schwester Maja hatte Albert Einstein\\nZeit seines Lebens ein inniges Vertrauensverhältnis. Erst im Alter\\nvon drei Jahren begann er zu sprechen und äußerte sich auch dann nur\\nzögerlich. 16  1884 begann er mit dem Violinspiel. Erst mit zwölf\\nmachte es ihm Spaß. Es blieb ihm sein Leben lang Quelle der\\nInspiration, auch für physikalische Einfälle. 17  Ebenfalls ab 1884\\nerhielt er Privatunterricht. Im Jahr darauf kam er in die Volksschule.\\nAuf seine Lehrer wirkte er sehr zurückhaltend und verträumt, sie\\nerklärten den Eltern, seine geistige und soziale Entwicklung sei\\nverlangsamt. Da er wenig sprach, wurde er vom Umfeld zunächst für\\nbegriffsstutzig gehalten. 18  19 \\nFOTOGRAFIEN AUS DER KINDHEIT\\n Das Foto gilt als das älteste bekannte von Albert Einstein und zeigt\\nihn dreijährig, 1882  \\nDas Foto gilt als das älteste bekannte von Albert Einstein und zeigt\\nihn dreijährig, 1882 \\n Albert Einstein etwa fünfjährig, zirka 1884, Porträtfotografie:\\nJoseph Albert  \\nAlbert Einstein etwa fünfjährig, zirka 1884, Porträtfotografie:\\nJoseph Albert \\n Albert Einstein und Maja, 1885, ETH-Bibliothek, Zürich  \\nAlbert Einstein und Maja, 1885, ETH-Bibliothek, Zürich \\n Albert Einstein und seine Schwester Maja  \\nAlbert Einstein und seine Schwester Maja \\nAb 1888 besuchte er das Luitpold-Gymnasium (nach verschiedenen\\nStandortwechseln erhielt es 1965 den Namen Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium\\nund ist nicht zu verwechseln mit dem heutigen Luitpold-Gymnasium in\\nMünchen). In der Schule war er ein aufgeweckter, bisweilen gar\\naufrührerischer Schüler, seine Leistungen waren gut bis sehr gut,\\nweniger gut in den Sprachen, aber herausragend in den\\nNaturwissenschaften.\\nEinstein als Jugendlicher, 1893\\nEinstein las populärwissenschaftliche Bücher und verschaffte sich\\neinen Überblick über den Forschungsstand. Besonders die\\n_Naturwissenschaftlichen Volksbücher_ von Aaron Bernstein gelten als\\nprägend für sein Interesse und seine weitere Laufbahn. 20  Hierzu\\nzählt auch 21  die Schrift von Felix Eberty _Die Gestirne und die\\nWeltgeschichte. Gedanken über Raum, Zeit und Ewigkeit,_ 22  zu deren\\nNeuauflage im Jahr 1923 Einstein ein Geleitwort schrieb. 23 \\nDas Unternehmen des Vaters und des geliebten Onkels wurde geschlossen\\nund die Familie zog 1894 nach Mailand. Der zu diesem Zeitpunkt\\nfünfzehnjährige Albert sollte bis zum Abitur am Luitpold-Gymnasium\\nbleiben, wurde jedoch von einem seiner Lehrer herabgesetzt und geriet\\nmit dem von Zucht und Ordnung geprägten Schulsystem des Deutschen\\nKaiserreiches in Konflikt – damit ging er allerdings offen um.\\nLehrer warfen ihm vor, dass seine Respektlosigkeit auf Mitschüler\\nabfärbe. Trotzig entschloss sich Einstein Ende 1894, die Schule ohne\\nAbschluss zu verlassen und seiner Familie nach Mailand zu folgen. Ein\\nweiteres Motiv war offensichtlich, sich der Wehrpflicht zu entziehen.\\nWäre Einstein bis zum Alter von 17 Jahren in Deutschland geblieben,\\nwäre er wehrpflichtig geworden – eine Aussicht, die ihn\\nschreckte. 24  Der spätere Antrag seines Vaters auf Entlassung aus\\nder württembergischen Staatsbürgerschaft wurde 1896 bewilligt.\\nFortan war Einstein jahrelang staatenlos.\\nSCHWEIZ 1895–1914\\nDER WEG ZUM STUDIUM: MATURA IN AARAU\\n Einsteins Maturazeugnis 1896 an der Kantonsschule Aarau; in der\\nSchweiz ist die 6 die beste und die 1 die schlechteste Note\\nIm Frühjahr und Sommer 1895 hielt sich Einstein in Pavia auf, wo\\nseine Eltern vorübergehend lebten, und half im Unternehmen mit. Er\\nlebte im Palazzo Cornazzani, machte Ausflüge in die Alpen und zum\\nApennin und besuchte seinen Onkel Julius Koch in Genua. In dieser Zeit\\nschrieb der 16-jährige Einstein seine erste wissenschaftliche Arbeit,\\nein Essay mit dem Titel _Über die Untersuchung des Ätherzustandes im\\nmagnetischen Felde,_ 25  und schickte sie seinem in Belgien lebenden\\nOnkel Caesar Koch (1854–1941) zur Begutachtung. Die Arbeit wurde nie\\nals wissenschaftlicher Beitrag in einer Zeitschrift veröffentlicht\\nund blieb in der Form eines Diskussionsbeitrages. 26 \\nEinsteins Wohnhaus in Aarau Albert Einstein, 16-jährig, Carte de\\nVisite von Gottfried Wolfsgruber, Aarau, 1895\\nDem Wunsch seines Vaters, er möge Elektrotechnik studieren, kam\\nEinstein nicht nach. Stattdessen folgte er dem Hinweis eines Freundes\\nder Familie und bewarb sich um einen Studienplatz an der\\nEidgenössischen Polytechnischen Schule in Zürich, der heutigen ETH\\nZürich. Da er noch kein Abitur beziehungsweise keine Schweizer Matura\\nhatte, legte er auf Vermittlung von Gustav Maier im Oktober 1895 eine\\nAufnahmeprüfung ab, 27  die er jedoch – als jüngster Teilnehmer\\naller Zeiten mit 16 Jahren – nicht bestand. Er meisterte den\\nnaturwissenschaftlichen Teil mit Bravour, scheiterte aber an\\nmangelnden Französischkenntnissen. Am Gewerbeinstitut Berlin, der\\nspäteren TH Berlin, wurde zu dieser Zeit ebenfalls ein Abitur als\\nZugangsberechtigung verlangt.\\nAuf Vermittlung seines Mentors Gustav Maier und des ebenfalls von ihm\\nüberzeugten Maschinenbauprofessors Albin Herzog besuchte er\\nanschließend die Gewerbeschule an der liberal geführten aargauischen\\nKantonsschule in der Schweiz, um dort die Matura nachzuholen. Während\\ndieser Zeit in Aarau kam er bei der Familie Winteler im Haus\\nLaurenzenvorstadt 119 unter. Er zog dort im Oktober 1895 für ein\\nJahr ein; bald begann eine Liaison mit der zwei Jahre älteren Marie\\nWinteler. 28  Anfang 1896 wurde Einstein auf Antrag seines Vaters aus\\nder württembergischen und somit auch der deutschen\\nStaatsbürgerschaft entlassen. 29  Er ließ sich als keiner\\nReligionsgemeinschaft zugehörig eintragen. Die nächsten fünf Jahre\\nblieb er staatenlos.\\nAuf Einsteins am 3. Oktober 1896 vom Erziehungsrat des Kantons Aargau\\nausgestellten Maturitätszeugnis stand fünfmal die bestmögliche\\nSchulnote, in der Schweiz eine Sechs. Die schlechteste Note war eine\\nDrei in Französisch. Das Gerücht, dass Einstein allgemein ein\\nschlechter Schüler war, ist falsch: Es geht auf Einsteins ersten\\nBiografen zurück, der das Benotungssystem der Schweiz mit dem\\ndeutschen verwechselte. 30  31 \\nSTUDIUM AM POLYTECHNIKUM IN ZÜRICH\\n Publikation von Einsteins Fachlehrerdiplom\\nNachdem Einstein die Matura an der Kantonsschule Aarau nachgeholt\\nhatte, nahm er mit Beginn des akademischen Jahres 1896 sein Studium an\\nder _Schule für Fachlehrer_ des Eidgenössischen Polytechnikums\\nZürich (heute ETH Zürich) auf. 26 \\nEs lag Einstein nicht, nur formales Wissen auswendig zu lernen,\\nvielmehr regten ihn theoretisch-physikalische Denkprojekte an. Mit\\nseiner Eigenwilligkeit eckte er oftmals an. Ihm war die abstrakte\\nmathematische Ausbildung ein Dorn im Auge, er erachtete sie als für\\nden problemorientierten Physiker hinderlich. In den Vorlesungen fiel\\ner dem lehrenden Professor vor allem durch seine Abwesenheit auf. Für\\ndie Prüfungen verließ er sich auf die Mitschriften seiner\\nKommilitonen. Diese Ignoranz verstellte ihm nicht nur Karrierechancen\\nan seiner Hochschule, er bereute sie spätestens bei der Entwicklung\\nder mathematisch höchst anspruchsvollen Allgemeinen\\nRelativitätstheorie. Sein Studienkollege Marcel Grossmann war ihm\\nspäter dabei noch von großer Hilfe.\\nAkademie Olympia – Habicht, Solovine und Einstein, 1903\\nEinstein verließ die Hochschule 1900 mit einem Diplom als _Fachlehrer\\nin mathematischer Richtung,_ worunter auch die Physik fiel. Seine\\nDiplomarbeit in Physik fertigte er bei Heinrich Friedrich Weber an. Es\\ngelang ihm aber nicht, nach dem Studium eine Anstellung als Assistent\\nam Polytechnikum zu erhalten.\\nVOM HAUSLEHRER ZUM PATENTAMT BERN\\n Beamter im Patentamt Bern, 1904 oder 1905\\nSeine Bewerbungen auf Assistentenstellen am Polytechnikum und anderen\\nUniversitäten wurden abschlägig beschieden. Er arbeitete als\\nAushilfslehrer am Technikum in Winterthur sowie als Hauslehrer in\\nSchaffhausen und schließlich in Bern. Einstein hatte 1899 begonnen,\\nsich für eine Schweizer Bürgerschaft zu bewerben. Offiziell\\nSchweizer Staatsbürger mit Heimatort Zürich wurde er am 21. Februar\\n1901. Er blieb Zeit seines Lebens Schweizer Staatsangehöriger. 32  Am\\n23. Juni 1902 trat Einstein, auf Empfehlung seines Freundes Marcel\\nGrossmann, eine feste Anstellung an: als technischer Experte 3. Klasse\\nbeim Schweizer Patentamt in Bern, nachdem der Gesamtbundesrat\\nEinsteins Anstellung eine Woche zuvor, am 16. Juni 1902, bewilligt\\nhatte. 33 \\nWährend der Probezeit am Patentamt begannen seine regelmäßigen\\nTreffen mit dem Philosophiestudenten Maurice Solovine und dem\\nMathematikstudenten Conrad Habicht, die als _Akademie Olympia_\\nbezeichnet wurden und 1904 endeten. 34 \\nFAMILIÄRE SITUATION\\n Mileva Marić und Albert Einstein, 1912\\nWährend des Studiums hatte Einstein seine Kommilitonin und spätere\\nEhefrau, Mileva Marić 35  aus Novi Sad, kennengelernt. Nach dem Tod\\nseines Vaters Ende 1902 heirateten die beiden am 6. Januar 1903 in\\nBern – gegen den Willen der Familien. Von Oktober 1903 bis Mai 1905\\nwohnten Einstein und Marić in der Berner Altstadt an der\\nKramgasse 49, dem heutigen Einsteinhaus Bern, in dem ein Museum\\nuntergebracht ist.\\nMit Marić hatte Einstein eine Tochter und zwei Söhne, Hans Albert\\n(1904–1973) und Eduard (1910–1965). Die Tochter Lieserl wurde 1902\\nvor der Eheschließung bei den Eltern von Marić in Novi Sad geboren\\nund starb entweder früh oder wurde 1903 zur Adoption nach Belgrad\\ngegeben. 36  Das Schicksal des Kindes ist trotz intensiver Suche\\nunbekannt. Die Existenz ihrer gemeinsamen Tochter wurde selbst vor den\\nFreunden verschwiegen. Erst 1987 wurde durch die Veröffentlichung der\\nBriefe Einsteins an Marić aus den Jahren 1897 bis 1903 bekannt, dass\\nvor der Eheschließung die gemeinsame Tochter geboren worden war. Die\\nEhe wurde 1919 geschieden. 37  38 \\nEin Buch von Desanka Trbuhovic-Gjuric, das zuerst 1969 erschien und\\nauch ins Deutsche übersetzt wurde, 39  vertrat die These, dass Mileva\\nMarić einen bedeutenden Anteil an den Arbeiten hatte, die 1905 zum\\nDurchbruch von Einstein als Wissenschaftler führten. Dafür konnten\\naber keine Belege gefunden werden, auch nicht, als viel mehr Dokumente\\nüber Einstein nach dem Beginn der Herausgabe der Gesammelten Werke\\n(ab 1987) bekannt wurden, darunter auch der erhaltene Briefwechsel mit\\nihr aus dieser Zeit (der auch separat veröffentlicht wurde). Im\\nGegenteil sprach alles dafür, dass sie ihm ähnlich wie der Ingenieur\\nMichele Besso als Diskussionspartnerin diente, was der Konsens\\nführender Einstein-Experten war (Abraham Pais, Albrecht Fölsing,\\nJohn Stachel, Gerald Holton). 40  Die Frage wird im Artikel über\\nMileva Marić aktuell jedoch eingehender diskutiert.\\nVON ERSTEN VERÖFFENTLICHUNGEN BIS ZUR BERÜHMTEN FORMEL E = MC²\\n(1905)\\n→ _Hauptartikel: Geschichte der speziellen Relativitätstheorie_\\nEinsteins Dissertation, 1905\\nIm Jahr 1905, im Alter von 26 Jahren, veröffentlichte Einstein fünf\\nseiner wichtigsten Werke:\\n     Am 17. März 1905 beendete er seine Arbeiten zum photoelektrischen\\nEffekt, die er anschließend als _Über einen die Erzeugung und\\nVerwandlung des Lichts betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt_ 41 \\npublizierte.\\n      Am 30. April 1905 stellte er seine Dissertation _Eine neue\\nBestimmung der Moleküldimensionen_ fertig, 42  mit der er am\\n20. Juli an der Universität Zürich bei den Professoren Alfred\\nKleiner und Heinrich Burkhardt sein Promotionsgesuch einreichte. Er\\nwählte die Universität Zürich, da dort aufgrund eines Abkommens mit\\ndem Polytechnikum, an dem Einstein studiert hatte, das Rigorosum\\n(mündliche Prüfung) entfiel. In seiner Dissertation berechnete er\\ndie Größe von Zuckermolekülen in Lösung und daraus einen Wert für\\ndie Avogadro-Konstante. Sie steht in Zusammenhang mit seiner im selben\\nJahr erschienenen Arbeit über die Brownsche Molekularbewegung und\\nstützte die damals bei führenden Physikern (Wilhelm Ostwald, Ernst\\nMach) noch umstrittene Atomhypothese. Die Arbeit wurde von Burkhardt\\nund Kleiner relativ schnell akzeptiert (im Juli wurde das\\nPromotionsverfahren abgeschlossen). Paul Drude, der Herausgeber der\\nAnnalen der Physik, an den Einstein die Arbeit geschickt hatte, war\\nmit dem gefundenen Wert für die Avogadro-Konstante nicht zufrieden\\nund verlangte Nachbesserungen; Einstein lieferte diese. 43  Das\\nführte zu einer halbjährigen Verzögerung der Publikation, und\\nEinstein wurde deshalb erst am 15. Januar 1906 formal promoviert.\\nVier Jahre später (1909), als Jean Perrins Versuche bekannt wurden,\\nwandte sich Einstein an Perrin mit der Bitte um experimentelle\\nÜberprüfung, und gleichzeitig fand Ludwig Hopf, den Einstein um\\nÜberprüfung seiner Dissertation gebeten hatte, einen Fehler in\\nseiner Dissertation, der das Ergebnis verfälscht hatte. Einstein\\nschickte 1911 eine Berichtigung an die Annalen. 44 \\n      Am 11. Mai 1905 folgte seine Publikation zur brownschen\\nMolekularbewegung: _Über die von der molekularkinetischen Theorie der\\nWärme geforderte Bewegung von in ruhenden Flüssigkeiten\\nsuspendierten Teilchen._ 45 \\n      Am 30. Juni 1905 reichte Einstein seine Abhandlung _Zur\\nElektrodynamik bewegter Körper_ ein. 46  Kurz darauf lieferte\\nEinstein seinen Nachtrag _Ist die Trägheit eines Körpers von seinem\\nEnergieinhalt abhängig?_ 47  Letzterer enthält implizit zum ersten\\nMal die wohl berühmteste Formel der Welt, _E = mc²_ (Energie ist\\ngleich Masse mal Lichtgeschwindigkeit zum Quadrat, Äquivalenz von\\nMasse und Energie). Beide Arbeiten zusammen werden heute Spezielle\\nRelativitätstheorie genannt.\\nDas Jahr 1905 war somit ein äußerst fruchtbares Jahr (Annus\\nmirabilis). Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker schrieb dazu später:\\n> „1905 eine Explosion von Genie. Vier Publikationen über\\n> verschiedene Themen, deren jede, wie man heute sagt,\\n> nobelpreiswürdig ist: die spezielle Relativitätstheorie, die\\n> Lichtquantenhypothese, die Bestätigung des molekularen Aufbaus der\\n> Materie durch die ‚brownsche Bewegung‘, die quantentheoretische\\n> Erklärung der spezifischen Wärme fester Körper.“\\n– Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker 48  \\nDIE SCHRITTE BIS ZUR NEUEN THEORIE DER GRAVITATION\\nAls Einstein 1907 den langen Weg von der Speziellen zur Allgemeinen\\nRelativitätstheorie antrat, war er noch ein weithin unbekannter\\nAngestellter im Berner Patentamt. Am Ende des Weges, 1915, war er ein\\nin Fachkreisen schon hochangesehener Professor in Berlin, der, wie Max\\nPlanck später sagte, nur „an den Leistungen Johannes Keplers und\\nIsaac Newtons gemessen“ werden könne. 49 \\nDer Weg zur Allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie begann 1907 zum einen mit\\ndem Geistesblitz, den Einstein als „den glücklichsten Gedanken\\nmeines Lebens“ 50  bezeichnete, zum anderen mit einer Einschränkung\\nseiner bisherigen Arbeiten zur Relativität, die grundsätzlicher\\nNatur war. Die Letztere war die Einsicht, dass die\\nLichtgeschwindigkeit unter dem Einfluss der Gravitation keine\\nKonstante ist, die Spezielle Relativitätstheorie demnach nur unter\\nder Bedingung gültig sein konnte, dass keine Schwerkraft vorhanden\\nsei, wie Einstein in einem Aufsatz von 1911 wiederholte: „Die\\nRelativitätstheorie hat ergeben, daß die träge Masse eines Körpers\\nmit dem Energieinhalt desselben wächst. (…) Das so befriedigende\\nResultat der Relativitätstheorie, nach dem der Satz von der Erhaltung\\nder Masse in dem Satz von der Erhaltung der Energie aufgeht, wäre\\nnicht aufrecht zu erhalten.“ 51 \\nDer Geistesblitz dagegen betraf die Äquivalenz zwischen träger und\\nschwerer Masse, also die Übereinstimmung der konstanten\\nBeschleunigung eines Bezugssystems und der Schwerkraft: „Ich saß\\nauf meinem Sessel im Berner Patentamt, als mir plötzlich folgender\\nGedanke kam: ‚Wenn sich eine Person im freien Fall befindet, dann\\nspürt sie ihr eigenes Gewicht nicht‘. Ich war verblüfft. Dieser\\neinfache Gedanke machte auf mich einen tiefen Eindruck. Er trieb mich\\nin Richtung einer Theorie der Gravitation.“ 52 \\nBis zur ersten Schrift, in der dieser Geistesblitz zu einer näheren\\nphysikalischen Formulierung führte, sollten allerdings noch über\\ndrei Jahre vergehen, denn „Einstein äußerte sich vom Dezember 1907\\nbis zum Juni 1911 (…) nicht über Fragen der Gravitation“, so sein\\nFreund und Biograph Abraham Pais. 53 \\nIm Jahr 1908 kam es aber zu einer bahnbrechenden Neuerung, der\\nEinstein zunächst skeptisch gegenüberstand und die er sogar als\\n„überflüssige Gelehrsamkeit“ 54  abtat: der mathematischen\\nFormulierung der Raumzeit durch seinen ehemaligen Lehrer Hermann\\nMinkowski, dessen Urheberschaft dieser revolutionären Konzeption\\nspäter von Einstein ausdrücklich anerkannt und gewürdigt wurde. 55 \\nIm Minkowski-Raum kann das relative Verhältnis der Größen von Raum\\nund Zeit in der Speziellen Relativitätstheorie durch die Setzung\\neiner imaginären Zeiteinheit anschaulich als Drehung dargestellt\\nwerden. Erst 1912 ließ sich Einstein von den Vorzügen des\\nMinkowski-Raums überzeugen.\\nEinige der wichtigsten Aufsätze der späteren Allgemeinen\\nRelativitätstheorie im Überblick:\\n     _Über das Relativitätsprinzip und die aus demselben gezogenen\\nFolgerungen._\\n      _Über den Einfluß der Schwerkraft auf die Ausbreitung des\\nLichtes._ Noch gemäß dem Huygensschen Prinzip stellt Einstein hier\\nnur eine Abweichung der Lichtstrahlen von Fixsternen in der Nähe der\\nSonne von 0,83 Bogensekunden fest, 56  der nach den Feldgleichungen\\nvon 1915 errechnete Wert lag bei 1,7 Bogensekunden. 57 \\n      _Entwurf einer verallgemeinerten Relativitätstheorie und einer\\nTheorie der Gravitation._ I.

November 1915.\\nDa die noch konventionelle Definition des Abstands im flachen (nicht\\ngekrümmten) Minkowski-Raum nicht gleichermaßen in der gekrümmten\\nRaumzeit gilt, musste sie dort durch einen abstrakteren Ausdruck\\nersetzt werden, wie auch eine Geometrie erforderlich war, mit der die\\nFlächentheorie von Gauß auf gekrümmte Räume in vier Dimensionen\\nerweitert werden konnte. Einsteins damalige mathematische Kenntnisse\\nreichten dafür nicht aus, und so wandte er sich 1912 an seinen\\nehemaligen Kommilitonen Marcel Grossmann, der nun in Zürich Professor\\nfür Mathematik war. Einstein habe „ihn gebeten, in der Bibliothek\\nnachzusehen, ob es eine geeignete Theorie zur Behandlung derartiger\\nFragen gäbe. Am nächsten Tag sei Grossmann gekommen (…) und habe\\ngesagt, es gebe tatsächlich eine derartige Geometrie, nämlich die\\nRiemannsche Geometrie.“ 61 \\nIn der Folge suchte Grossmann nicht nur die Arbeiten von Bernhard\\nRiemann hervor, sondern auch jene von Christoffel, Ricci und dessen\\nSchüler Levi-Civita, die mit den Forschungen zum absoluten\\nDifferentialkalkül in gekrümmten Räumen, der Formulierung der\\nChristoffelsymbole zur Tensoranalysis und der kovarianten Ableitung\\nteils bereits im 19., teils erst im 20. Jahrhundert das mathematische\\nInstrumentarium entwickelt hatten, das sich nun zur Formulierung der\\nAllgemeinen Relativitätstheorie als unverzichtbar erwies. 62  63 \\nEs dauerte aber noch etwa drei Jahre, um den Gedanken eines\\nGravitationsfeldes, in dem die Metrik des vierdimensionalen,\\ngekrümmten raumzeitlichen Kontinuums und die Faktoren der Energie und\\ndes Impulses sich wechselseitig bedingen, in eine Formel zu fassen,\\nwas Einstein am 4. November 1915 gelang.\\nPROFESSUR\\n Denkmal in Prag in der Nähe des Jan-Hus-Platzes\\nEinsteins Antrag auf Habilitation 1907 an der Berner Universität\\nwurde zunächst abgelehnt, weil er seine Habilitationsschrift nicht\\nmiteingereicht hatte. 64  1908 war er damit erfolgreich. 1909 berief\\nman ihn zum Dozenten 65  für theoretische Physik an der Universität\\nZürich, bald zum außerordentlichen Professor. Im Januar 1911 wurde\\ner, wie Unterrichtsminister Stürgkh kundmachte, von Kaiser Franz\\nJoseph I. zum ordentlichen Professor der theoretischen Physik an der\\nK.k. deutschen Karl-Ferdinands-Universität Prag ernannt. 66  Damit\\nwurde er österreichischer Staatsbürger. 67  Im Oktober 1912 kehrte\\ner nach Zürich zurück, um an der Eidgenössischen Technischen\\nHochschule zu forschen und zu lehren; er kehrte also als Professor an\\nseinen Studienort zurück. 68  Einstein empfand ein Leben lang Zürich\\nals seine Heimatstadt und die Schweiz als das Land, dem er zugewandt\\nwar. 69 \\nBERLINER JAHRE 1914–1932\\n Berliner Gedenktafel am Haus Ehrenbergstraße 33 in Berlin-Dahlem \\nBERUFLICHE BEGEGNUNGEN UND FAMILIÄRE EINSCHNITTE\\n1913 gelang es Max Planck, Einstein als hauptamtlich besoldetes\\nMitglied für die Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften in Berlin zu\\ngewinnen, wo er im April 1914 eintraf. Seine Frau kam mit den Kindern\\nnach, kehrte jedoch alsbald wegen privater Differenzen nach Zürich\\nzurück, weil Einstein sie dazu nötigte. 70  Einstein erhielt die\\nLehrberechtigung an der Berliner Universität, aber ohne Verpflichtung\\ndazu. Von allen Lehrtätigkeiten befreit, fand Einstein in Berlin Zeit\\nund Ruhe, sein großes Werk, die Allgemeine Relativitätstheorie, zu\\nEnde zu bringen. Er konnte sie 1916, zusammen mit einer Arbeit über\\nden Einstein-de-Haas-Effekt, veröffentlichen. Zeitweise war Einstein\\nbei der Mercur Flugzeugbau als beratender Ingenieur und für die\\nLuftverkehrsgesellschaft tätig. Sein Interesse galt dabei der\\npraktischen Umsetzung seiner Theorien von Wellen; sein Entwurf für\\nein Tragflächenprofil („Katzenbuckel“) war jedoch nicht\\nerfolgreich. 71  Seine Haltung zum Krieg schilderte er ausführlich in\\neinem Schreiben, das derzeit in der Berliner Staatsbibliothek\\nöffentlich ausgestellt wird. 72  73  Am 1. Oktober 1917 wurde er\\nDirektor des Kaiser-Wilhelm-Instituts für Physik und blieb in dieser\\nPosition bis 1933. Von 1923 bis 1933 war Einstein auch Mitglied des\\nSenats der Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft.\\nElsa Löwenthal und Albert Einstein an Bord der _Rotterdam_, April\\n1921 Einstein eröffnet die Funkausstellung in Berlin 1930\\nZwischen 1917 und 1920 pflegte seine Cousine Elsa Löwenthal (geb.\\nEinstein; 1876–1936) den kränkelnden Einstein. Infolgedessen zog\\nEinstein 1917 förmlich in der Haberlandstr. 5 in Elsas Wohnung ein.\\nAls Albert Einstein 1918 einen Ruf aus Zürich erhielt, entschied er\\nsich wegen der ausgezeichneten Wissenschaftlerkontakte dafür, in\\nBerlin zu bleiben, obwohl er im Sommerurlaub 1918 betonte, dass\\nZürich seine „wirkliche Heimat“ sei und die Schweiz das Land, dem\\ner allein mit seiner Neigung zugetan sei. 74  1919 lotete Einstein ein\\nAngebot aus Zürich aus, offenbar um in Berlin Bleibegelder zu\\nerwirken. Fritz Haber besorgte diese Gelder. 75 \\nEinstein ließ sich Anfang 1919 von Mileva scheiden, wenig später, am\\n2. Juni 1919, heiratete er Elsa. 76  Sie brachte zwei Töchter mit in\\ndie Ehe. Jene Zeit war mit weiteren Einschnitten verbunden: Die\\npolitische Situation nach Ende des Ersten Weltkrieges verhinderte den\\nKontakt zu seinen Söhnen in der Schweiz. Anfang 1919 erkrankte\\nEinsteins Mutter Pauline Einstein erneut schwer an Krebs. Einstein\\nholte sie Ende 1919 zu sich nach Berlin. Sie starb am 20. Februar 1920\\nin seinem Arbeitszimmer. 77  Außerdem gelang es Kurt Blumenfeld\\ngerade jetzt, Einstein für den Zionismus zu interessieren. Vollends\\nfür den Zionismus gewann Einstein 1921 Chaim Weizmann, der ihn zu\\neiner Reise in die USA überredete, auf der Einstein Spenden für die\\nHebrew University in Jerusalem warb. 78 \\nDie Berliner Jahre waren auch durch einen regen Kontakt zu Max\\nWertheimer, dem Begründer der Gestalttheorie, gekennzeichnet. Es kam\\nzu einem fruchtbaren Austausch zwischen den beiden Wissenschaftlern.\\nSo verfasste Einstein beispielsweise eine Einleitung zu Wertheimers\\nAufsätzen über Wahrheit, Freiheit, Demokratie und Ethik. Zunehmend\\nbegann er, sich auch politischen Fragestellungen zu öffnen (siehe\\nhierzu den Abschnitt Politisches Engagement).\\nZusammen mit Leopold Infeld gehörte er zu den häufigen Besuchern der\\nFamilie der Antonie „Toni“ Mendel († 1956), der Tante und\\nSchwiegermutter von Bruno Mendel, mit der er eine enge Freundschaft\\npflegte. Diese hatte er etwa Anfang der 1920er Jahre über die\\ngemeinsame Mitgliedschaft im pazifistischen Bund Neues Vaterland\\nkennengelernt. 79 \\nEXPERIMENTELLE BESTÄTIGUNG DER VORHERBERECHNETEN LICHTABLENKUNG\\n(1919)\\nWährend der Sonnenfinsternis vom 29. Mai 1919 bestätigten\\nBeobachtungen Arthur Stanley Eddingtons, dass die Ablenkung des Lichts\\neines Sterns durch das Schwerefeld der Sonne näher an dem von der\\nAllgemeinen Relativitätstheorie vorhergesagten Wert lag als an dem\\nder newtonschen Korpuskeltheorie. Joseph John Thomson, Präsident der\\nRoyal Society, kommentierte den Befund wie folgt:\\n> „Dieses Resultat ist eine der größten Errungenschaften des\\n> menschlichen Denkens.“ 80 \\nDie experimentelle Bestätigung der damals kurios anmutenden\\nVorhersage Einsteins machte weltweit Schlagzeilen. Die plötzliche\\nBekanntheit sorgte fortan dafür, dass sich Einsteins Vorträge\\ngrößter Beliebtheit erfreuten. Jeder wollte den berühmten\\nWissenschaftler _in persona_ erleben. In den Jahren von 1920 bis 1924\\nentstand auf Initiative von Erwin Freundlich, einem langjährigen\\nMitstreiter, der Einsteinturm in Potsdam. Er diente seither\\nastronomischen Beobachtungen, nicht zuletzt zu dem Zweck, Einsteins\\nTheorie weiteren Überprüfungen zu unterziehen.\\nVERLEIHUNG DES NOBELPREISES (1922)\\n Albert Einstein, offizielle Porträtfotografie Nobelpreis 1921\\nDer Nobelpreis für Physik des Jahres 1921 wurde erst am 9. November\\n1922 vergeben: an Albert Einstein „für seine Verdienste um die\\ntheoretische Physik, besonders für seine Entdeckung des Gesetzes des\\nphotoelektrischen Effekts“. 81  Einstein hatte sich am 7. Oktober\\nin Marseille zu einer Vortragsreise nach Japan eingeschifft, wo er am\\n17. November eintraf, und konnte deshalb an der Verleihungszeremonie\\nin Stockholm am 10. Dezember 1922 nicht teilnehmen. 82  83  84  Dort\\nübernahm es der Gesandte des Deutschen Reiches Rudolf Nadolny,\\n„seinen Preis aus den Händen S. M. des Königs zu empfangen“ und\\nbeim abendlichen Bankett im Grand Hôtel Stockholm „auch in seinem\\nNamen“ Dankesworte zu sprechen. 85  86  Das Preisgeld überließ\\nEinstein, wie es in der Scheidungsurkunde bereits festgelegt worden\\nwar, Mileva Marić und ihren gemeinsamen Söhnen. 87 \\nRabindranath Tagore und Albert Einstein, 1930 \\nBAU DES „EINSTEINHAUSES“\\n Sommerhaus von Albert Einstein in Caputh bei Potsdam\\nAnlässlich Einsteins 50. Geburtstag im Jahr 1929 sah sich die Stadt\\nBerlin gefordert, ihrem berühmten Bürger ein angemessenes Geschenk\\nzu überreichen. Oberbürgermeister Gustav Böß regte an, ihm ein\\nHaus zu schenken. Die Presse griff die Geschichte auf. Mit der Zeit\\nweitete sich die Diskussion jedoch zu einer offenen Kontroverse aus.\\nEinstein und Elsa, mittlerweile auf der Suche nach einem geeigneten\\nGrundstück in der Waldstraße 7 im Dorf Caputh bei Potsdam fündig\\ngeworden, verzichteten kurzerhand auf das Geschenk und finanzierten\\ndas heute _Einsteinhaus_ genannte Haus aus eigener Tasche. Der\\nArchitekt Konrad Wachsmann wurde beauftragt, das zweistöckige\\nHolzhaus am Hang oberhalb des Sees zu errichten. Es wurden teilweise\\nvorgefertigte Holzelemente verwendet. 88  Das Sommerhaus in Caputh war\\nder Ausgangspunkt für viele Touren mit dem Segelboot während der\\nSommermonate bis 1932. Dieses Boot (ein Geburtstagsgeschenk von\\nFreunden) war ein „20er Jollenkreuzer“ mit dem Namen _Tümmler,_\\nder 1933 mit Einsteins übrigem Besitz von den Nationalsozialisten\\nkonfisziert wurde. 89 \\nDIE KONFRONTATION MIT NIELS BOHR\\n1930 konfrontierte Albert Einstein Niels Bohr bei der sechsten\\nSolvay-Konferenz überraschend mit seinem Gedankenexperiment der\\nPhotonenwaage, mit dem er die Unvollständigkeit der Quantentheorie\\nbelegen wollte. Nur einen Tag später konnte Bohr zusammen mit\\nWolfgang Pauli und Werner Heisenberg Einstein unter Hinzuziehen von\\nÜberlegungen aus der Allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie jedoch\\nwiderlegen.\\nPRINCETON 1932–1955\\nREISETÄTIGKEIT UND DEUTSCHE AUSBÜRGERUNG\\nSeine zunehmende Bekanntheit nutzte Einstein für etliche Reisen: Mit\\nGenehmigung des preußischen Kultusministeriums hielt er Vorlesungen\\nauf der ganzen Welt. 1921 unternahm er seine erste Reise in die USA\\nmit mehrmonatigem Aufenthalt. 90  Zahlreiche Ehrendoktorwürden wurden\\nihm zuteil, darunter die der Princeton University, wo er später\\nlehrte. Alsbald plante er, fortan die Hälfte des Jahres in Princeton,\\nNew Jersey, die andere in Berlin zu verbringen. In Berlin war er wegen\\nseiner pazifistischen Haltung zunehmend zum Gegenstand politischer\\nDebatten geworden. Im Dezember 1932 reiste er erneut nach Pasadena\\n(Kalifornien). Einstein reiste nach der Machtergreifung des NS-Regimes\\n(30. Januar 1933) im März/April 1933 nach Europa; er gab in der\\ndeutschen Botschaft in Brüssel seinen Reisepass zurück. 91 \\nDer Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, der er 19 Jahre lang\\nangehört hatte, teilte er am 28. März 1933 schriftlich (mit\\nBedauern) seinen Austritt mit und würdigte die Anregungen und\\nmenschlichen Beziehungen dort. Damit kam er einem Ausschluss zuvor,\\nder sich nach der Veröffentlichung einer nicht für die Presse\\nbestimmten pazifistischen Erklärung abzeichnete. 92  Am 20. März\\nhatte man Einsteins Haus in Caputh durchsucht, im April auch seine\\nStadtwohnung in der Berliner Haberlandstraße 5 (heute Neubau,\\nNr. 8). Am 4. April 1933 stellte Einstein einen Antrag auf\\nAusbürgerung (Entlassung aus dem preußischen Staatsverbund). Ein\\nvierseitiger Brief vom 28. März 1933 an Einsteins Schwester Maja, in\\ndem Einstein und seine Gattin ihren Wunsch nach Ausbürgerung\\nmitteilen, wurde im Jahre 2018 versteigert. 93  Der Antrag wurde\\nabgelehnt, seinem Wunsch knapp ein Jahr später aber doch entsprochen,\\nindem ihm die Staatsangehörigkeit per Strafausbürgerung (am\\n24. März 1934) aberkannt wurde. Er wurde seinerzeit auf die zweite\\nAusbürgerungsliste des Deutschen Reichs gesetzt. 94 \\nAm 8. April 1933 wandte sich die Bayerische Akademie der\\nWissenschaften an ihn und bat ihn um eine Erklärung bezüglich seiner\\nHaltung zur Bayerischen Akademie, in die er 1927 als\\nkorrespondierendes Mitglied aufgenommen worden war. Einstein\\nantwortete am 21. April aus dem belgischen Ferienort De Haan, die\\nGründe für sein Ausscheiden aus der Preußischen Akademie würden an\\nund für sich _nicht_ eine Lösung seiner Beziehungen zur Bayerischen\\nAkademie bedingen. Dennoch wünsche er, aus der Mitgliederliste\\ngestrichen zu werden. Die Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher\\nLeopoldina hatte Einstein bereits Anfang 1933 mit einem\\nBleistifteintrag in ihren Matrikelbüchern als Mitglied\\ngestrichen. 95  96  Am 10. Mai 1933 proklamierte der\\nPropagandaminister Joseph Goebbels: „Jüdischer Intellektualismus\\nist tot“ 97  und ließ im Rahmen der öffentlichen Verbrennung\\n„undeutschen Schrifttums“ symbolisch auch Schriften von Einstein\\nverbrennen. Einstein fand auch heraus, dass sein Name auf einer\\nAttentatsliste mit Kopfgeld von 5000 Dollar stand. 97  Johann von\\nLeers setzte seinen Namen in seinem Buch _Juden sehen Dich an_ auf\\neine Liste der „Lügenjuden“ mit dem Kommentar\\n„Ungehängt“. 98 \\nSUCHE NACH DER WELTFORMEL\\n1933 wurde Einstein Mitglied des Institute for Advanced Study, eines\\nkurz zuvor in der Nähe der Princeton University gegründeten privaten\\nForschungsinstituts. Es gelang ihm, fast seinen gesamten Besitz,\\ndarunter seinen Flügel, von Berlin nach Princeton transportieren zu\\nlassen, weil Frankreichs Botschafter André François-Poncet ihn als\\nDiplomatengepäck nach Frankreich bringen ließ. 99  Vom August 1935\\nbis zu seinem Tod lebte Einstein im Haus Mercer Street 112 in\\nPrinceton. Es war das erste eigene Haus, das ganzjährig bewohnbar\\nwar, das Albert und Elsa Einstein besaßen. 100  Die Stadt Princeton\\nbildete damals einen Mikrokosmos der modernen Forschung. Einstein\\nbefasste sich bald mit der Suche nach einer einheitlichen Feldtheorie,\\ndie seine Feldtheorie der Gravitation (die Allgemeine\\nRelativitätstheorie) mit der des Elektromagnetismus vereinigen\\nsollte. Bis zu seinem Tode mühte er sich vergeblich, eine Weltformel\\nzu finden – was bis heute auch keinem anderen Forscher gelungen ist.\\nPRIVATE SITUATION IM EXIL\\n Einwanderungsurkunde von Januar 1936 Am 1. Oktober 1940 erhielt\\nEinstein von Richter Phillip Forman die amerikanische\\nEinbürgerungsurkunde\\nSeine letzte Auslandsreise außerhalb der USA nach seiner\\nÜbersiedlung dorthin unternahm Einstein 1935 auf die zu\\nGroßbritannien gehörenden Bermudainseln, ein Zwangsaufenthalt aus\\nformalen Gründen, da er damals noch nicht US-Staatsbürger war. 101 \\nIm Jahr 1936 starb Einsteins Ehefrau Elsa. 1939 kam seine Schwester\\nMaja nach Princeton, allerdings ohne ihren Mann Paul, der keine\\nEinreisegenehmigung erhalten hatte. Sie wohnte bis zu ihrem Tod 1951\\nbei ihrem Bruder.\\nIm Jahr 1938 half er zusammen mit Thomas Mann dem Schriftsteller\\nHermann Broch, der im zuvor „angeschlossenen“ Österreich kurze\\nZeit inhaftiert worden war, ebenfalls in die Vereinigten Staaten zu\\nemigrieren. Beide blieben im Exil miteinander befreundet. Wie diesem\\nverhalf Einstein auch seinem Caputher Architekten Konrad Wachsmann und\\nzahlreichen weiteren bedrohten jüdischen Künstlern und\\nWissenschaftlern durch Empfehlungsschreiben und Gutachten zur Ausreise\\naus Deutschland und zur Einreise in die USA. 102 \\nAm 15. Dezember 1938 trat er aus der Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in\\nRom aus, nachdem diese zuvor alle 27 jüdischen italienischen\\nMitglieder ausgeschlossen hatte. 103 \\nAm 1. Oktober 1940 erhielt Einstein die Staatsbürgerschaft der\\nVereinigten Staaten. Die Schweizer Staatsbürgerschaft mit Heimatort\\nZürich behielt er zeitlebens.\\nEINSTEINS WARNUNG VOR EINER DEUTSCHEN ATOMBOMBE\\nDie Entdeckung der Kernspaltung im Dezember 1938 durch Otto Hahn und\\nFritz Straßmann in Berlin beschwor in der Wissenschaftsgemeinde die\\nErkenntnis einer nuklearen Bedrohung herauf. Im August 1939, kurz vor\\nBeginn des Zweiten Weltkriegs, unterzeichnete Einstein einen von Leó\\nSzilárd verfassten Brief 104  an den amerikanischen Präsidenten\\nFranklin D. Roosevelt, der vor der Gefahr einer „Bombe neuen Typs“\\nwarnte, die Deutschland möglicherweise entwickle und gar bald\\nbesitzen könne. 105  Angesichts von Geheimdienstberichten um\\nentsprechende deutsche Anstrengungen fand der Appell Gehör, und\\nzusätzliche Forschungsgelder wurden bereitgestellt: Das\\nManhattan-Projekt mit dem erklärten Ziel der Entwicklung einer\\nAtombombe war aus der Taufe gehoben.\\nIn seinen Memoiren vertritt Einstein die Auffassung, dass er sich zu\\nleichtfertig von der Notwendigkeit der Unterzeichnung dieses Briefes\\nüberzeugen ließ. Am 16. November 1954 sagte er zu seinem Freund\\nLinus Pauling:\\n> “I made one great mistake in my life – when I signed the letter\\n> to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but\\n> there was some justification – the danger that the Germans would\\n> make them.”\\n> „Ich habe einen schweren Fehler in meinem Leben gemacht – als\\n> ich den Brief an Präsident Roosevelt mit der Empfehlung zum Bau von\\n> Atombomben unterzeichnete; aber es gab eine gewisse Rechtfertigung\\n> dafür – die Gefahr, dass die Deutschen welche bauen würden.“\\n– Albert Einstein: Aufzeichnung Linus Paulings 106 \\nEntgegen dieser späteren Erinnerung enthielt der\\nEinstein-Szilárd-Brief keine explizite Empfehlung zum Bau einer\\nKernwaffe durch die USA. Vielmehr machte er Roosevelt auf die neuesten\\nErgebnisse der Uranforschung und deren Konsequenzen aufmerksam,\\nempfahl der US-Regierung diese Forschung im Auge zu behalten und zu\\nfördern und warnte vor der Möglichkeit, dass Nazi-Deutschland eine\\nAtombombe bauen könnte, was mit dem Uranprojekt tatsächlich versucht\\nwurde.\\nAm Manhattan-Projekt der USA war Einstein jedoch gänzlich\\nunbeteiligt. Vannevar Bush fragte ihn zwar im Dezember 1941 um Rat zu\\neinem Problem, das in Zusammenhang mit der Isotopentrennung stand, das\\nFBI und offizielle Stellen in Washington stuften ihn aber unter\\nanderem wegen seiner unverhüllten Sympathien für den Kommunismus als\\nSicherheitsrisiko ein, und er wurde von den US-amerikanischen\\nGeheimdiensten beobachtet. Weder durfte er in technische Einzelheiten\\ndes streng geheimen Projekts eingeweiht werden, noch überhaupt\\noffiziell von dessen Existenz erfahren. Er war aber an einer\\nZusammenarbeit mit dem US-Militär interessiert und beriet ab Mai 1943\\ndie US Navy über Sprengstoffe und Torpedos. 107  Als Beitrag zu den\\nKriegsanstrengungen stiftete er sein Originalmanuskript über die\\nSpezielle Relativitätstheorie von 1905, das in Kansas City im Februar\\n1944 für 6,5 Millionen US-Dollar versteigert wurde, die in\\nKriegsanleihen der USA investiert wurden.\\n1945 trat Leó Szilárd erneut an ihn heran, diesmal zur Verhinderung\\ndes Einsatzes von Atomwaffen nach der Kapitulation Deutschlands, und\\nEinstein schrieb ein wegen Roosevelts Tod folgenlos gebliebenes\\nEmpfehlungsschreiben für Szilárd an den Präsidenten, damit Szilárd\\nbei diesem seine Bedenken vortragen konnte. Nach dem Abwurf der\\nAtombombe wurde Einstein, der zunächst schwieg, zur Stellungnahme\\ngedrängt, nachdem sein Schreiben an Roosevelt von 1939 durch den\\nSmyth Report bekannt geworden war. In einem Interview mit einem\\nJournalisten der _New York Times_ sprach er sich im September 1945\\nfür eine Weltregierung aus, um künftig Kriege zu verhüten, kam\\ndarauf auch im Rahmen einer Nobel-Gedenkrede im Dezember 1946 in New\\nYork zurück und engagierte sich in dem von Szilárd ins Leben\\ngerufenen _Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists_, setzte sein\\nEngagement für internationale Rüstungskontrolle aber auch nach\\ndessen Ende 1948 fort. Über seine eigene Beteiligung bei der\\nInitiierung des Manhattan-Projekts urteilte er im März 1947 in einem\\n_Newsweek_-Interview, dass er dies nicht getan hätte, wenn er vom\\ngeringen Fortschritt der Deutschen in deren Atombombenprojekt gewusst\\nhätte, und dass die Entwicklung im Übrigen auch ohne ihn erfolgt\\nwäre. 108 \\nEMERITIERUNG\\n Albert Einstein und Robert Oppenheimer, um 1950\\nNach dem Krieg prägte sich der Öffentlichkeit das Bild des alten,\\nsich nachlässig kleidenden Professors in Princeton ein. Er wurde\\nhäufig um Stellungnahmen ersucht und von hohen Staatsgästen besucht\\nwie Jawaharlal Nehru. Auch nach seiner Emeritierung 1946 arbeitete er\\nweiter mit Assistenten am Institute for Advanced Study an seiner\\nVereinheitlichten Feldtheorie. Seine letzten Jahre waren durch den Tod\\nseiner Schwester Maja 1951 und anderer Freunde getrübt. Im selben\\nJahr führte Einsteins Aussage im antikommunistisch motivierten\\nProzess gegen den Bürgerrechtler W. E. B. Du Bois zur Einstellung des\\nVerfahrens. 109  Im Mai 1953 nahm er in einem in der _New York Times_\\nveröffentlichten Brief gegen die McCarthy-Ausschüsse Stellung und\\nrief zur Aussageverweigerung auf. 1954 unterstützte er Robert\\nOppenheimer in dessen Sicherheitsanhörungen.\\nHALTUNG ZU DEUTSCHLAND\\nDie von Deutschen betriebene Vernichtung der Juden während der Zeit\\ndes Nationalsozialismus war für Einstein der Grund dafür, die\\nallgemeine Ablehnung bis zu seinem Lebensende aufrechtzuerhalten. So\\nschrieb er in einem Brief an Arnold Sommerfeld im Dezember 1945:\\n„Nachdem die Deutschen meine jüdischen Brüder in Europa\\nhingemordet haben, will ich nichts mehr mit Deutschen zu tun haben,\\nauch nichts mit einer relativ harmlosen Akademie.“ 110  Er fügte\\nauf Sommerfeld und einige andere bezogen hinzu: „Anders ist es mit\\nden paar Einzelnen, die in dem Bereich der Möglichkeit standhaft\\ngeblieben sind.“ 111 \\nAuch Jahre nach dem Krieg sah er kein ausgeprägtes Reue- oder\\nSchuldgefühl in Deutschland und vermied weiter jegliche Einlassung\\nmit den dortigen öffentlichen Institutionen. Ein Ansinnen von Otto\\nHahn, Mitglied der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zu werden, wies er brüsk\\nmit ebenso deutlichen Worten zurück wie jenes von Sommerfeld, ihn\\nwieder in die Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften aufzunehmen, oder\\ndas von Theodor Heuss bezüglich des Ordens Pour le Mérite. Er wollte\\nauch nicht, dass seine Bücher künftig in Deutschland\\nerscheinen. 112  Auf die Nachricht, dass sein Freund Max Born zurück\\nnach Deutschland ziehen wollte, reagierte er mit Unverständnis. Seine\\nAbneigung gegen Deutschland übertrug er allerdings nicht generell auf\\neinzelne Personen oder Kollegen, insbesondere nicht, wenn sie wie\\nSommerfeld, Max Planck und Max von Laue Distanz zu den\\nNationalsozialisten bewahrt hatten. 113 \\nSORGE UM DEN FRIEDEN\\nTrotz seiner Gebrechen fand er auch noch kurz vor seinem Tod die\\nnötige Kraft, um für seine Vision vom Weltfrieden einzutreten. So\\nunterzeichnete er am 11. April 1955 zusammen mit zehn weiteren\\nnamhaften Wissenschaftlern das sogenannte Russell-Einstein-Manifest\\nzur Sensibilisierung der Menschen für die Abrüstung. 114  Die\\nletzten Notizen von Einstein betreffen eine Rede, die er zum Jahrestag\\nder israelischen Unabhängigkeit halten wollte. An dem Entwurf\\narbeitete er noch am 13. April 1955 zusammen mit dem israelischen\\nKonsul. Am Nachmittag desselben Tages brach Einstein zusammen und\\nwurde zwei Tage später ins Princeton Hospital gebracht. 114 \\nTOD\\nEinstein starb am 18. April 1955 im Alter von 76 Jahren in Princeton\\nan inneren Blutungen, die durch die Ruptur eines Aortenaneurysmas\\nverursacht worden waren. Einstein lehnte die (seinerzeit\\nexperimentelle) operative Behandlung ab, mit den Worten:\\n> “I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life\\n> artificially. I have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it\\n> elegantly.”\\n> „Ich will gehen, wenn ich möchte. Es ist geschmacklos, das Leben\\n> künstlich zu verlängern. Ich habe meinen Teil getan; es ist Zeit\\n> zu gehen. Ich werde es elegant tun.“ 115 \\nEinstein litt häufig unter starken Bauchschmerzen. Als Rudolf Nissen,\\nein Sauerbruch-Schüler, Einstein am 31. Dezember 1948 operierte, fand\\ner ein riesiges Bauchaortenaneurysma, das vom Zwerchfell bis an die\\nBifurkation reichte. Zum damaligen Zeitpunkt waren das Entfernen und\\nErsetzen durch eine Prothese noch keine Option. Sein Hausarzt Rudolf\\nEhrmann klärte Einstein über das Risiko eines Einrisses auf und\\nverbot ihm u. a. strikt das Rauchen. 116  117  Wegen seiner\\ngesundheitlichen Probleme hatte er schon seit Ende der 1940er Jahre\\nPrinceton kaum mehr verlassen. 118  Die Nachtschwester Alberta Rozsel\\ndes _Princeton Hospital_ war bei Einstein, als er starb. Sie\\nberichtete, dass er kurz vor seinem Tod etwas auf Deutsch gemurmelt\\nhabe. 119  Der Pathologe Thomas Harvey stahl nach der Obduktion das\\nGehirn und die Augen von Albert Einstein. Seine Intention war vor\\nallem, das Gehirn für weitere Untersuchungen seiner womöglich\\neinzigartigen Struktur der Nachwelt zu erhalten.\\nDer größte Teil des Gehirns befindet sich heute konserviert im\\n_National Museum of Health and Medicine_ in Chicago, die Augen in New\\nYork. Der Rest seines Körpers wurde, seinem Wunsch entsprechend,\\nverbrannt und die Asche an einem unbekannten Ort verstreut. 120  Der\\nösterreichische Schriftsteller Franzobel veröffentlichte im Jahr\\n2023 einen Roman über die Geschichte von Harveys Umgang mit Einsteins\\nGehirn. 121 \\nNATURWISSENSCHAFTLICHE ENTDECKUNGEN UND ERFINDUNGEN\\nPHYSIK\\nRELATIVITÄTSTHEORIE\\nAlbert Einstein begründete die physikalische Relativitätstheorie,\\ndie er (nach wichtigen Vorarbeiten von Hendrik Antoon Lorentz und\\nHenri Poincaré) 1905 als Spezielle Relativitätstheorie und erstmals\\n1915 als Allgemeine Relativitätstheorie veröffentlichte. Einsteins\\nWerke führten zu einer Revolution der Physik; die Spezielle und die\\nAllgemeine Relativitätstheorie gehören bis heute zu den\\nGrundpfeilern der modernen Physik. Zur einfacheren Formulierung\\nführte er 1916 die einsteinsche Summenkonvention ein, durch die\\nTensorprodukte kompakter geschrieben werden können.\\nGEGENSTAND DES NOBELPREISES\\n Nobelpreis 1921, am 10. Dezember 1922 überreicht Einsteins Vorlesung\\nam 11. Juli 1923 in Göteborg\\nEinstein war ab 1910 mit zunehmender Häufigkeit für den Nobelpreis\\nvorgeschlagen worden, besonders auch ab 1919 nach der öffentlichen\\nSensation der richtigen Vorhersage der Lichtablenkung durch\\nGravitation. Das stieß im Nobelpreiskomitee aber auf anhaltenden\\nWiderstand, der auch dazu führte, dass der Preis für das Jahr 1921\\nnicht termingerecht vergeben wurde, sondern erst ein Jahr später\\nzusammen mit dem Preis für 1922. Viele Mitglieder des\\nNobelpreiskomitees neigten eher zur Experimentalphysik als zur\\ntheoretischen Physik und beargwöhnten die theoretischen Entwicklungen\\nzur Quantennatur des Lichts und zu den beiden Relativitätstheorien\\nals zu spekulativ. Während Einsteins Gesetz des photoelektrischen\\nEffekts inzwischen durch Messungen belegt war, wurde die 1919 von\\nArthur Stanley Eddington bei Sonnenfinsternisbeobachtungen berichtete\\nBeobachtung einer von der Allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie\\nvorhergesagten Ablenkung des Lichts von Sternen nahe der Sonne\\n(Gravitationslinseneffekt) wegen mangelnder Messgenauigkeit weiter\\nbezweifelt. Besonders Allvar Gullstrand, der auch verschiedene Fehler\\nin Einsteins Theorien gefunden zu haben glaubte, verhinderte entgegen\\nstärkster internationaler Befürwortung noch 1921 die Nominierung\\nEinsteins.\\nSo erhielt Einstein zwar den für das Jahr 1921 bestimmten\\nPhysik-Nobelpreis, aber erst ein Jahr später und dabei weder für\\neine seiner Relativitätstheorien noch für die Lichtquantenhypothese,\\nmit der er das Gesetz des photoelektrischen Effekts gefunden hatte,\\nsondern lediglich für die Entdeckung dieses Gesetzes. 122  123  Für\\nseine Nobelpreisrede erhielt er die Auflage, sich nicht zur\\nRelativitätstheorie zu äußern. Wegen eines Aufenthalts in Japan\\nnahm Einstein nicht am offiziellen Staatsakt im Dezember 1922 teil,\\nsondern nahm den Preis am 11. Juli 1923 auf der 17. Nordischen\\nNaturforscherversammlung _(17:e Skandinaviska Naturforskarmötet)_ in\\nGöteborg entgegen und hielt – zum Gefallen des anwesenden\\nschwedischen Königs und tausend weiterer Zuhörer – seine Rede mit\\ndem Titel _Grundgedanken und Probleme der\\nRelativitätstheorie._ 124  125  Antisemitische Physiker aus\\nDeutschland, darunter Philipp Lenard, der Nobelpreisträger 1905,\\nhatten zuvor noch vergeblich protestiert.\\nQUANTENPHYSIK\\n Albert Einstein mit Niels Bohr 1930 in Brüssel,\\nFotografie von Paul Ehrenfest Von Robert Berks geschaffene Statue\\nEinsteins im Hof der Israelischen Akademie der Wissenschaften\\nBemerkenswert ist Einsteins Verhältnis zu einem weiteren Pfeiler der\\nmodernen Physik, der Quantenphysik: einerseits, weil einiges von\\nseiner Arbeit, wie die Erklärung des photoelektrischen Effekts, deren\\nGrundlage bildete; andererseits, weil er später viele Ideen und\\nDeutungen der Quantenmechanik ablehnte. Eine berühmte Diskussion\\nverbindet Einstein mit dem Physiker Niels Bohr. Gegenstand war die\\nunterschiedliche Auslegung der neuen Quantentheorie, die Heisenberg,\\nSchrödinger und Dirac ab 1925 entwickelten. Einstein stand\\ninsbesondere dem Begriff der Komplementarität Bohrs kritisch\\ngegenüber.\\nEinstein glaubte, dass die zufälligen Elemente der Quantentheorie\\nsich später als nicht wirklich zufällig beweisen lassen würden.\\nDiese Einstellung veranlasste ihn, erstmals im Streit mit Max Born, zu\\nder berühmt gewordenen Aussage, dass der Alte (bzw. Herrgott) nicht\\nwürfle: 126 \\n> „Die Quantenmechanik ist sehr achtunggebietend. Aber eine innere\\n> Stimme sagt mir, daß das noch nicht der wahre Jakob ist. Die\\n> Theorie liefert viel, aber dem Geheimnis des Alten bringt sie uns\\n> kaum näher. Jedenfalls bin ich überzeugt, daß der Alte nicht\\n> würfelt.“\\nEr stützte seine Überlegungen mit verschiedenen\\nGedankenexperimenten, unter anderem mit dem viel diskutierten\\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Experiment oder mit der Photonenwaage. Im\\nDiskurs jedoch blieben Bohr und seine Anhänger zumeist siegreich;\\nauch aus heutiger Sicht sprechen die experimentellen Belege gegen\\nEinsteins Standpunkt.\\nLASER\\n1916 postulierte er die stimulierte Emission von Licht. 127  Dieser\\nquantenmechanische Vorgang ist die physikalische Grundlage des Lasers,\\nder erst 1960 – also nach seinem Tod – erfunden wurde. Neben dem\\nTransistor zählt der Laser zu den bedeutendsten technischen\\nErfindungen des 20. Jahrhunderts, die auf die Quantenphysik\\nzurückgehen.\\nBOSE-EINSTEIN-KONDENSATION\\n1924 sagte er zusammen mit Satyendranath Bose einen\\nquantenmechanischen, aber dennoch makroskopischen Materiezustand\\nvoraus, der bei extrem tiefen Temperaturen eintreten sollte. Der\\nspäter als Bose-Einstein-Kondensation bezeichnete Phasenübergang\\nkonnte 1995 erstmals im Labor beobachtet werden. Im August 2005 wurde\\nan der Universität Leiden ein 16-seitiges Manuskript von Einstein\\nentdeckt, das sich mit seiner letzten großen Entdeckung, der\\nBose-Einstein-Kondensation, beschäftigt.\\nEINHEITLICHE FELDTHEORIE\\nIn seinen späten Jahren beschäftigte sich Einstein mit der Frage\\nnach einer einheitlichen Feldtheorie aller Naturkräfte auf Grundlage\\nseiner Allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie; ein Unterfangen, das\\nallerdings nicht von Erfolg gekrönt war und noch heute ungelöst ist.\\nHäufig wird Einstein als einer derjenigen genannt, die einen\\nhypothetischen Äther ablehnten und abschaffen wollten; das war jedoch\\nnur einschränkend der Fall, wie in einer seiner Reden deutlich wird,\\ngehalten am 5. Mai 1920 an der Reichs-Universität zu Leiden:\\n> „Zusammenfassend können wir sagen: Nach der Allgemeinen\\n> Relativitätstheorie ist der Raum mit physikalischen Qualitäten\\n> ausgestattet; es existiert also in diesem Sinne ein Äther. Gemäß\\n> der Allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie ist ein Raum ohne Äther\\n> undenkbar; denn in einem solchen gäbe es nicht nur keine\\n> Lichtfortpflanzung, sondern auch keine Existenzmöglichkeit von\\n> Maßstäben und Uhren, also auch keine räumlich-zeitlichen\\n> Entfernungen im Sinne der Physik. Dieser Äther darf aber nicht mit\\n> der für ponderable Medien charakteristischen Eigenschaft\\n> ausgestattet gedacht werden, aus durch die Zeit verfolgbaren Teilen\\n> zu bestehen; der Bewegungsbegriff darf auf ihn nicht angewendet\\n> werden.“ 128 \\nEinstein lässt im Sinne dieser Zusammenfassung weiterhin nur einen\\nvon der Elektrodynamik unabhängigen, gravitativen Äther zu, nicht\\njedoch den elektromagnetischen Äther des 19. Jahrhunderts mit seinen\\nerforderlichen Bewegungszuständen, die – wie schon 1905 – nach\\nwie vor ausdrücklich ausgeschlossen werden. Diese Tatsache kommt in\\nder oft zitierten Rede von 1920, etwas vor obiger Zusammenfassung,\\nebenfalls deutlich zum Ausdruck. 129 \\n> „Betrachten wir das Gravitationsfeld und das elektromagnetische\\n> Feld vom Standpunkt der Ätherhypothese, so besteht zwischen beiden\\n> ein bemerkenswerter prinzipieller Unterschied. Kein Raum und auch\\n> kein Teil des Raumes ohne Gravitationspotentiale; denn diese\\n> verleihen ihm seine metrischen Eigenschaften, ohne die er überhaupt\\n> nicht gedacht werden kann. Die Existenz des Gravitationsfeldes ist\\n> an die Existenz des Raumes unmittelbar gebunden. Dagegen kann ein\\n> Raumteil sehr wohl ohne elektromagnetisches Feld gedacht werden.“\\nTECHNIK\\nEinstein ist als theoretischer Physiker weltberühmt. Einem\\numfassenden Bild seiner wissenschaftlichen Persönlichkeit fehlt aber\\neine Facette, wenn man seine Leistungen als Experimentalphysiker und\\nIngenieur nicht berücksichtigt.\\nEINSTEIN-DE-HAAS-EFFEKT\\n1915 führte Einstein zusammen mit Wander Johannes de Haas ein\\nschwieriges Experiment durch. Durch den heute als\\nEinstein-de-Haas-Effekt bekannten Effekt bestimmte er indirekt das\\ngyromagnetische Verhältnis oder den Landé-Faktor des Elektrons. Da\\ndamals der Spin noch nicht bekannt war, glaubte man, der\\nFerromagnetismus beruhe auf dem Umlauf der Elektronen um den Atomkern\\n(ampèresche Molekularströme), was einen Landé-Faktor von 1 bedeutet\\nhätte. Die Schwierigkeit des Experiments verursachte größere\\nstatistische und systematische Fehler; jedoch kam eine Messreihe dem\\nvorhergesagten Wert 1 sehr nahe und wurde von Einstein und de Haas als\\nexperimenteller Nachweis des Modells angesehen und veröffentlicht.\\nSpätere Experimente mit höherer Genauigkeit zeigen jedoch, dass sich\\nein Landé-Faktor von ungefähr 2 ergibt, wie er nicht für den Umlauf\\ndes Elektrons, sondern für seinen Spin gilt. Dies zeigt, dass der\\nFerromagnetismus nicht vom Bahndrehimpuls der Elektronen herrührt.\\nKREISELKOMPASS\\nZur Technik des Kreiselkompasses trug Einstein durch seine Erfindungen\\nder elektrodynamischen Lagerung und des elektrodynamischen Antriebs\\nfür die Kreisel bei. Einschlägige Fachkenntnisse hatte Einstein\\nerworben, als er 1914 in einer patentrechtlichen Auseinandersetzung\\nzwischen Hermann Anschütz-Kaempfe und Elmer Ambrose Sperry als\\nGutachter bestellt worden war. Mechanische Kreiselkompasse werden auch\\nheute noch mit Einsteins patentierter Technik gebaut.\\nKÜHLMITTELPUMPE\\n Der Einstein-Kühlschrank\\nEs wird berichtet, dass Einstein und sein Kollege Leó Szilárd durch\\nein tragisches Unglück mit den damals üblichen giftigen\\nKältemitteln motiviert wurden, im Hinblick auf sichere Kühlschränke\\nzu forschen. Eines der von Einstein und Szilárd angemeldeten Patente\\nbetraf eine elektrodynamische Pumpe für ein leitendes Kältemittel.\\nIn den Vereinigten Staaten erhielten beide für den Kühlschrank das\\nUS-Patent Nummer 1.781.541 am 11. November 1930 zugebilligt. 130 \\nObwohl Einstein mehrere seiner Patente verkaufen konnte, unter anderem\\nan AEG und Electrolux, wurden seine Kühlschränke nie gebaut, da 1929\\ndas Kältemittel Freon eingeführt wurde und somit die einsteinschen\\nPatente mit einem Schlag obsolet waren. An einer Stelle hat Einsteins\\nErfindung dennoch überlebt: Die Pumpen für das Kühlmittel in\\nschnellen Brutreaktoren, nämlich für flüssiges Natrium, werden\\nimmer noch nach Einsteins Prinzip konstruiert.\\nKATZENBUCKELFLÜGEL\\nVermutlich angeregt durch Ludwig Hopf beschäftigte sich Einstein zu\\nBeginn des Ersten Weltkrieges mit den Strömungseigenschaften von\\nFlugzeugtragflächen und entwarf um 1916 ein Tragflächenprofil, bei\\ndem er durch Verzicht auf den Anstellwinkel den Luftwiderstand\\nverringern wollte. In dem Zusammenhang veröffentlichte er im August\\n1916 die Arbeit _Elementare Theorie der Wasserwellen und des Fluges._\\nDie Luftverkehrsgesellschaft in Berlin-Johannisthal setzte Einsteins\\nKonstruktionsvorschläge um, und die Tragflächen wurden aufgrund\\nihrer wenig eleganten Form als _Katzenbuckelflügel_ bezeichnet. Ein\\nTestflug zeigte dann jedoch, dass die Konstruktion aufgrund ihrer\\nschlechten Flugeigenschaften unbrauchbar war. Der Testpilot Paul Georg\\nEhrhardt hatte große Mühe gehabt, das Flugzeug wieder zu landen und\\nbezeichnete es als eine „schwangere Ente“. Einstein selbst war\\nspäter, wohl auch im Hinblick auf mögliche militärische\\nAnwendungen, froh, dass sich seine Vorschläge als unbrauchbar\\nerwiesen hatten, und schämte sich seiner „Narretei aus jenen\\nTagen“. 131  132  133  134 \\nPOLITISCHES ENGAGEMENT\\nPOSITIONSBESTIMMUNG\\nEinstein empfand bereits als Neunzehnjähriger während der Ära des\\nWilhelminismus zum ausgehenden 19. Jahrhundert solchen Abscheu vor\\ndem Militarismus und der Autoritätshörigkeit in der Gesellschaft des\\nKaiserreichs, dass er seine deutsche Staatsbürgerschaft ablegte. 135 \\nDer Beginn des Ersten Weltkrieges bewirkte eine intensive\\nBeschäftigung mit politischen Problemen. Einstein trat dem Bund Neues\\nVaterland (der späteren _Deutschen Liga für Menschenrechte_) bei und\\nunterstützte dessen Forderungen nach einem baldigen, gerechten\\nFrieden ohne Gebietsforderungen und der Schaffung einer\\ninternationalen Organisation, die künftige Kriege verhindern sollte.\\nAn seinen Kollegen Paul Ehrenfest schrieb er 1914:\\n> „Die internationale Katastrophe lastet schwer auf mir\\n> internationalem Menschen. Man begreift schwer beim Erleben dieser\\n> «großen Zeit», daß man dieser verrückten, verkommenen Spezies\\n> angehört, die sich Willensfreiheit zuschreibt. Wenn es doch\\n> irgendwo eine Insel der Wohlwollenden und Besonnenen gäbe! Da\\n> wollte ich auch glühender Patriot sein.“ 136 \\nDie Novemberrevolution von 1918 begrüßte Einstein mit großer\\nBegeisterung. 137  Damals gehörte er zu den Unterzeichnern eines\\nAufrufs zur Gründung der linksliberalen Deutschen Demokratischen\\nPartei (DDP). Später trat er jedoch nicht mehr öffentlich für diese\\nPartei auf, dafür näherte er sich immer stärker einem humanistisch\\ngeprägten sozialistischen Gedankengut an. Im Verlauf der Weimarer\\nRepublik engagierte er sich weiterhin in der Deutschen Liga für\\nMenschenrechte, in der er sich für politische Gefangene einsetzte. In\\ndiesem Zusammenhang arbeitete er auch zeitweilig für die\\nkommunistisch dominierte Rote Hilfe.\\nAls Aushängeschild Deutschlands wird Einstein zusammen mit Max Planck\\nam 28. Juni 1931 in die Reichskanzlei eingeladen, als es darum ging,\\nden englischen Premierminister Ramsay MacDonald gewogen zu stimmen. In\\neinem Brief vom 3. Oktober 1931 an Reichskanzler Brüning wirbt\\nEinstein für die strukturelle Nichtangriffsfähigkeit Deutschlands\\ngegenüber Frankreich, allerdings ohne Erfolg, weil Brüning die\\nVerständigungspolitik gegenüber Frankreich nicht mehr betrieb. 138 \\n1932 trat er als Unterzeichner des Dringenden Appells zusammen mit\\nHeinrich Mann, Ernst Toller, Käthe Kollwitz, Arnold Zweig und anderen\\nfür ein antifaschistisches Linksbündnis aus SPD, KPD und\\nGewerkschaften ein, um den Untergang der Weimarer Republik und die\\ndrohende Herrschaft des Nationalsozialismus noch zu verhindern.\\nPAZIFISMUS\\nNoch vor der regulären Zulassung Deutschlands zum Völkerbund und\\nbevor deutsche Wissenschaftler regulär am wissenschaftlichen\\ninternationalen Leben teilhaben konnten, wurde Albert Einstein 1922\\nauf Einladung von Henri Bergson Mitglied der Kommission für geistige\\nZusammenarbeit (International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation\\nICIC) des Völkerbunds. In seiner Rolle als Pazifist und\\nInternationalist galt er als „undeutschester Deutscher“ der\\nEinsitz in die Kommission erhielt, was nicht zur Popularität des ICIC\\nin Deutschland beitrug. Bereits 1923 trat Einstein aus Protest über\\ndie französische Politik im Rahmen der Ruhrgebietsbesetzung aus der\\nKommission aus. Seinen Austritt begründete er zusätzlich damit, dass\\ner sich durch den wachsenden Antisemitismus nach der Ermordung Walther\\nRathenaus nicht noch weiter öffentlich exponieren möchte. Einstein\\nließ sich allerdings unter anderem von Marie Curie, die ebenfalls\\nKommissionsmitglied war, wieder zum Beitritt bewegen. 139  Mit George\\nEllery Hale und Einstein war das ICIC längere Zeit die einzige\\nVölkerbundsorganisation, welche einen Deutschen und Amerikaner zu\\nseinen Mitgliedern zählen konnte. 140  1932 trat Einstein erneut aus\\nder Kommission aus. Bereits 1933 erschien in der vom Institut für\\nGeistige Zusammenarbeit (eine mit dem ICIC verwandte Organisation)\\nherausgegebenen Reihe _Correspondance_ \"Warum Krieg? Ein\\nBriefwechsel\". Die Schrift beinhaltete einen Briefwechsel zwischen\\nEinstein und Sigmund Freud und wurde später für die pazifistische\\nBewegung bedeutsam. Aufgrund der pazifistisch-internationalistischer\\nInhalte der Schrift versuchten eher rechtsnationale deutsche\\nMitglieder des Instituts für Geistige Zusammenarbeit nach 1933 sich\\nvom Institut zu distanzieren, ohne gleichzeitig die eigene Arbeit zu\\ndiskreditieren. 141 \\nÜberhaupt griff Einstein immer wieder zum Mittel des Briefschreibens,\\num Wirkung zu erzielen. Im Mai 1931 beispielsweise machte er gemeinsam\\nmit Heinrich Mann in einem offenen Brief an die New York Times auf die\\nErmordung des kroatischen Intellektuellen Milan von Šufflay\\naufmerksam. 142  1935 beteiligte er sich an der (erfolgreichen)\\ninternationalen Kampagne für die Verleihung des Friedensnobelpreises\\nan den im KZ einsitzenden Carl von Ossietzky; 1953 forderte er in\\neinem öffentlichen Brief die Verteidigung der Bürgerrechte\\ngegenüber dem McCarthy-Ausschuss ein. Anfang März 1933 überließ er\\nwährend eines Aufenthaltes in den USA der Liga zur Bekämpfung des\\nAntisemitismus eine nach seiner eigenen Aussage nicht für die Presse\\nbestimmte Erklärung, die große Aufmerksamkeit in der internationalen\\nPresse nach sich zog. Darin schrieb er:\\n> „Solange mir eine Möglichkeit offensteht, werde ich mich nur in\\n> einem Land aufhalten, in dem politische Freiheit, Toleranz und\\n> Gleichheit aller Bürger vor dem Gesetz herrschen. Zur politischen\\n> Freiheit gehören die Freiheit der mündlichen und schriftlichen\\n> Äußerung politischer Überzeugung, zur Toleranz die Achtung vor\\n> jeglicher Überzeugung eines Individuums. Diese Bedingungen sind\\n> gegenwärtig in Deutschland nicht erfüllt. … Ich hoffe, daß in\\n> Deutschland bald gesunde Verhältnisse eintreten werden und daß\\n> dort in Zukunft die großen Männer wie Kant und Goethe nicht nur\\n> von Zeit zu Zeit gefeiert werden, sondern daß sich auch die von\\n> ihnen gelehrten Grundsätze im öffentlichen Leben und im\\n> allgemeinen Bewußtsein durchsetzen.“ 103 \\nGleichzeitig modifizierte er seine pazifistische Haltung:\\n> „Bis 1933 habe ich mich für die Verweigerung des Militärdienstes\\n> eingesetzt. Als aber der Faschismus aufkam, erkannte ich, dass\\n> dieser Standpunkt nicht aufrechtzuerhalten war, wenn nicht die Macht\\n> der Welt in die Hände der schlimmsten Feinde der Menschheit geraten\\n> soll. Gegen organisierte Macht gibt es nur organisierte Macht; ich\\n> sehe kein anderes Mittel, so sehr ich es auch bedaure.“ 143 \\nAuch der Brief an Präsident Franklin D. Roosevelt, der der\\nEntwicklung der Atombombe vorausging, entsprang dieser Haltung:\\n> „Ich glaubte, wir müssten die Möglichkeit Deutschlands\\n> vermeiden, unter Hitler im alleinigen Besitz dieser Waffe zu sein.\\n> Das war die wirkliche Gefahr dieser Zeit.“ 144 \\nEntsprechend engagierte er sich nach der Niederlage NS-Deutschlands\\nvielfältig für internationale Rüstungskontrolle und Zusammenarbeit\\nim Sinne des Titels einer Rede, die er 1945 bei einem\\nNobel-Gedenkdinner in New York hielt: _The war is won, but peace is\\nnot._ So rief er ein _Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists_ ins\\nLeben und schlug die Bildung einer Weltregierung vor.\\nEinstein stand auch Gewalt gegenüber Tieren ablehnend gegenüber und\\nsympathisierte mit der Idee des Vegetarismus. Vermutlich ernährte er\\nsich aber erst gegen Ende seines Lebens selbst vegetarisch. 145  146 \\nZIONISMUS\\n Einstein zusammen mit führenden Vertretern des Zionismus (zweiter\\nvon links: Chaim Weizmann), 1921 Einstein bei seinem einzigen Besuch\\nin der Region Palästina in Haifa, Februar 1923 Palme vor dem\\nTechnion, die Einstein am 11. Februar 1923 pflanzte, 2012\\nBei der Berufung zur Karls-Universität in Prag (1911) bezeichnete\\nsich Einstein zunächst als „konfessionslos“. Erst auf Druck der\\nösterreich-ungarischen Verwaltung zur Erklärung seiner\\nGlaubensrichtung bekannte er sich als Angehöriger des Judentums.\\nSpäter zeigte Einstein jedoch, betroffen von der Lage\\nosteuropäischer jüdischer Flüchtlinge nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg,\\nein vermehrtes Engagement für einen Staat Israel. Dokumentiert ist\\n1918 seine Teilnahme an einem vorläufigen Komitee zur Vorbereitung\\neines jüdischen Kongresses in Deutschland. Zu jener Zeit erlebte das\\nDeutsche Reich bereits eine zunehmende Durchdringung mit\\nAntisemitismus.\\nEr unterstützte weitgehend die zionistischen Ideale, ohne jedoch\\njemals einer zionistischen Organisation beizutreten. Nachdem er\\nzunächst als Jugendlicher aus der jüdischen Religionsgemeinschaft\\nausgetreten war, wurde er 1924 Mitglied der jüdischen Gemeinde in\\nBerlin, wobei er dies jedoch nicht aus religiösen Gründen tat,\\nsondern um seine Solidarität mit dem Judentum zu demonstrieren. 147 \\nSein Name ist außerdem stark mit der Hebräischen Universität in\\nJerusalem verbunden. Seine erste USA-Reise diente unter anderem dem\\nZweck, Spenden für eine solche Universität zu sammeln. 1923 reiste\\ner zur Grundsteinlegung in das damalige Palästina – während\\ndieser Reise wurde ihm auch die erste Ehrenbürgerschaft der Stadt Tel\\nAviv verliehen. 1925 wurde er zum Mitglied des Verwaltungsrats der\\nUniversität berufen. Schließlich verfügte Einstein in seinem\\nTestament die Übereignung seines schriftlichen Nachlasses an die\\nHebräische Universität.\\nEinsteins Beziehung zum Judentum war offenbar nicht religiöser Natur.\\nSo schrieb er 1946:\\n> „Obgleich ich so etwas wie ein jüdischer Heiliger bin, habe ich\\n> seit so langer Zeit keine Synagoge mehr besucht, dass ich fürchten\\n> muss, Gott würde mich nicht mehr erkennen. Und wenn Er es täte,\\n> wäre es wohl schlimmer.“ 148 \\nAls Menachem Begin kurz nach der Unabhängigkeit des Staates Israel\\nNew York besuchte, um dort für seine neugegründete Cherut-Partei\\nSpenden zu sammeln, gehörte Albert Einstein am 4. Dezember 1948 zu\\nden Unterzeichnern eines Leserbriefes an die New York Times, der in\\nscharfen Formulierungen vor der Cherut-Partei (die 1973 im heutigen\\nLikud aufging) warnte. 149 \\nNach dem Tod Chaim Weizmanns erhielt Einstein 1952 das Angebot, der\\nzweite Staatspräsident des neu gegründeten Staates Israel zu werden,\\nwas er aber ablehnte. 150 \\nIm Dezember 1982 erhielt die Hebräische Universität in Jerusalem das\\nPrivatarchiv Albert Einsteins. Das Material stammt aus der Zeit von\\n1901 bis 1955 und umfasst 50.000 Seiten und bis 1982 rund 33\\nunveröffentlichte Manuskripte.\\nSOZIALISMUS\\nEinstein verfasste 1949 seinen wenig bekannten Essay _Why Socialism?_\\n(„Warum Sozialismus?“), 151  in dem er seine politische\\nEinstellung darlegte: Obwohl er einräumt, kein Experte auf dem Gebiet\\nder Wirtschaft zu sein, hält er eine Stellungnahme für statthaft:\\n> „ …  wir sollten nicht davon ausgehen, dass Experten die\\n> einzigen sind, die ein Recht darauf haben, sich zu Fragen zu\\n> äußern, die die Organisation der Gesellschaft betreffen.“\\nEr betonte die Abhängigkeit des Einzelnen von der Gesellschaft und\\ndie Möglichkeit, die Gesellschaft zu gestalten:\\n> „Das Gedächtnis, die Kapazität, Neues zu versuchen und die\\n> Möglichkeit, mündlich zu kommunizieren haben für den Menschen\\n> Entwicklungen möglich gemacht, die nicht von biologischen\\n> Gegebenheiten diktiert wurden. Solche Entwicklungen manifestieren\\n> sich in Traditionen, Institutionen und Organisationen, in der\\n> Literatur, in wissenschaftlichen und technischen Errungenschaften,\\n> in künstlerischen Arbeiten. Das erklärt, weshalb der Mensch in\\n> einem gewissen Sinne sein Leben selbst beeinflussen kann und dass in\\n> diesem Prozess bewusstes Denken und Wollen eine Rolle spielt.“\\nAm Kapitalismus kritisierte er, dass er der Gesellschaft in ihren\\nBedürfnissen an die Wirtschaft nicht gerecht werde:\\n> „Die Produktion ist für den Profit da – nicht für den Bedarf.\\n> Es gibt keine Vorsorge dafür, dass all jene, die fähig und bereit\\n> sind zu arbeiten, immer Arbeit finden können.“\\nDies habe Einfluss bis hinein ins Bildungssystem:\\n> „Unbegrenzte Konkurrenz führt zu einer riesigen Verschwendung von\\n> Arbeit und zu dieser Lähmung des sozialen Bewusstseins von\\n> Individuen, die ich zuvor erwähnt habe. Diese Lähmung der\\n> Einzelnen halte ich für das größte Übel des Kapitalismus. Unser\\n> ganzes Bildungssystem leidet darunter. Dem Studenten wird ein\\n> übertriebenes Konkurrenzstreben eingetrichtert und er wird dazu\\n> ausgebildet, raffgierigen Erfolg als Vorbereitung für seine\\n> zukünftige Karriere anzusehen  …  Nach meiner Überzeugung gibt\\n> es nur einen Weg zur Beseitigung dieser schweren Übel, nämlich die\\n> Etablierung der sozialistischen Wirtschaft, vereint mit einer auf\\n> soziale Ziele eingestellten Erziehung: Die Arbeitsmittel werden\\n> Eigentum der Gesellschaft und werden von dieser planwirtschaftlich\\n> verwendet.“\\nEr forderte aber auch, dass der erstrebte Sozialismus die Rechte des\\nIndividuums respektieren müsse:\\n> „Eine Planwirtschaft als solche kann mit der totalen Versklavung\\n> des Individuums einhergehen. Sozialismus erfordert die Lösung\\n> einiger äußerst schwieriger sozio-politischer Probleme: Wie ist es\\n> angesichts weitreichender Zentralisierung politischer und\\n> ökonomischer Kräfte möglich, eine Bürokratie daran zu hindern,\\n> allmächtig und maßlos zu werden? Wie können die Rechte des\\n> Einzelnen geschützt und dadurch ein demokratisches Gegengewicht zur\\n> Bürokratie gesichert werden?  …  Klarheit über die Ziele und\\n> Probleme des Sozialismus ist für unsere Zeit des Überganges von\\n> größter Bedeutung. Leider ist bei dem jetzigen Zustand der\\n> Gesellschaft die freie Diskussion dieser Dinge durch ein mächtiges\\n> Tabu erschwert.“\\nDamit warf er auch Fragen auf, die im Ostblock ihre Aktualität\\nzeigten (Stalinismus). Anders als bei seinen anderen Idealen blieb\\neine solche Diskussion zu Zeiten des Kalten Krieges im Westen\\nunbeachtet, weshalb der Text außerhalb sozialistischer Kreise kaum\\nVerbreitung fand. In den USA wurde Einstein wegen seiner politischen\\nAnsichten vom FBI überwacht. 152  Agenten hörten nicht nur sein\\nTelefon ab und sahen seine Post ein, sondern durchsuchten auch seinen\\nMüll. Die FBI-Akte mit sog. „belastenden Informationen“ gegen\\nEinstein umfasst insgesamt 1800 Seiten. 153 \\nEinstein war Mitglied der Gesellschaft der Freunde des neuen Rußland,\\ndie die Freundschaft zwischen Deutschland und der Sowjetunion\\npropagierte. Außerdem war er Ehrenpräsident der Sowjetisch-deutschen\\nGesellschaft „Kultur und Technik“. 154 \\nSCHWANGERSCHAFTSABBRUCH, HOMOSEXUALITÄT UND SEXUALERZIEHUNG\\nDie im März 1922 von Magnus Hirschfeld dem Reichstag vorgelegte\\nPetition zur Abschaffung des § 175 wurde von Einstein und anderen\\nProminenten unterzeichnet. 155 \\nDie Neue Generation, Organ des Deutschen Bundes für Mutterschutz,\\nzitierte 1929 einen Brief Einsteins vom 6. September 1929 an die\\nWeltliga für Sexualreform, Institut für Sexualwissenschaft, Berlin:\\n> „Ich verfüge nicht über eine so reiche menschliche Erfahrung,\\n> daß ich berechtigt wäre, mich zu diesen schwierigen sozialen\\n> Fragen öffentlich zu äußern. Das Gefühl einer gewissen\\n> Sicherheit habe ich nur in folgendem Punkt: Abtreibung bis zu einem\\n> gewissen Stadium der Schwangerschaft soll auf Wunsch der Frau\\n> erlaubt sein. Homosexualität sollte bis auf den notwendigen Schutz\\n> Jugendlicher straffrei sein. Bezüglich der Sexualerziehung keine\\n> Geheimniskrämerei.“ 156  157  158 \\nSpäter gehörte Einstein zu den Unterstützern oder Sympathisanten\\neines _Komitees für Selbstbezichtigung gegen § 218_, siehe\\nSchwangerschaftsabbruch#Deutsches Reich.\\nEINSTELLUNG ZUR RELIGION\\nEinstein entstammt einer jüdischen Familie. Bei seiner\\nVerzichtserklärung auf die württembergische Staatsbürgerschaft im\\nJahre 1896 vermerkte sein Vater jedoch, vermutlich auf seinen Wunsch,\\n„keine religiöse Zugehörigkeit“, was er in den folgenden zwei\\nJahrzehnten mehrmals wiederholte. 159 \\nBis ins 21. Jahrhundert gibt es verschiedene Interpretationen zu\\nEinsteins Haltung zur Religion, da er sich vielfach widersprüchlich\\näußerte, unter anderem mit dem Aphorismus: „Wissenschaft ohne\\nReligion ist lahm, Religion ohne Wissenschaft ist blind.“ 160  Im\\nJahre 2008 wurde jedoch ein bis dahin in Privatbesitz befindlicher\\nBrief von Einstein an den Esoteriker Erich Gutkind veröffentlicht,\\nden er am 3. Januar 1954 verfasst hatte. In diesem bezieht sich\\nEinstein auf seine nichtreligiöse Haltung. 161  Er distanziert sich\\ndabei mit deutlichen Worten von der biblischen Vorstellung eines\\npersönlichen Gottes, die er als „primitiven Aberglauben“\\nbezeichnet:\\n> „Das Wort Gott ist für mich nichts als Ausdruck und Produkt\\n> menschlicher Schwächen, die Bibel eine Sammlung ehrwürdiger, aber\\n> doch reichlich primitiver Legenden.  …  Für mich ist die\\n> unverfälschte jüdische Religion wie alle anderen Religionen eine\\n> Incarnation des primitiven Aberglaubens. Und das jüdische Volk, zu\\n> dem ich gerne gehöre und mit dessen Mentalität ich tief verwachsen\\n> bin, hat für mich doch keine andersartige Dignität als alle\\n> anderen Völker. Soweit meine Erfahrung reicht ist es auch um nichts\\n> besser als andere menschliche Gruppen, wenn es auch durch Mangel an\\n> Macht gegen die schlimmsten Auswüchse gesichert ist. Sonst kann ich\\n> nichts „Auserwähltes“ an ihm wahrnehmen.“\\nIn einem anderen Brief schreibt er 1954:\\n> „Es war natürlich eine Lüge, was Sie über meine religiösen\\n> Überzeugungen gelesen haben, eine Lüge, die systematisch\\n> wiederholt wird. Ich glaube nicht an einen persönlichen Gott und\\n> ich habe dies niemals geleugnet, sondern habe es deutlich\\n> ausgesprochen. Falls es in mir etwas gibt, das man religiös nennen\\n> könnte, so ist es eine unbegrenzte Bewunderung der Struktur der\\n> Welt, so weit sie unsere Wissenschaft enthüllen kann.“ 160 \\nIn einem von insgesamt 27 persönlichen Briefen Einsteins, die im Juni\\n2015 vom Auktionshaus _Profiles in History_ in Los Angeles versteigert\\nwurden, antwortet Einstein dem Geschichtslehrer Guy Raner im Jahr 1949\\nauf die Frage nach seinem Glauben:\\n> “I have repeatedly said that in my opinion the idea of a personal\\n> God is a childlike one  … . You may call me an agnostic, but I do\\n> not share the crusading spirit of the professional atheist… I\\n> prefer an attitude of humility corresponding to the weakness of our\\n> intellectual understanding of nature and of our own being.”\\n> „Ich habe wiederholt gesagt, dass meiner Meinung nach die\\n> Vorstellung eines persönlichen Gottes eine kindliche ist  … . Sie\\n> können mich einen Agnostiker nennen, aber ich teile nicht den\\n> Kreuzzugsgeist des professionellen Atheisten… Ich bevorzuge eine\\n> Haltung der Demut, die der Schwäche unseres intellektuellen\\n> Verständnisses der Natur und unseres eigenen Wesens\\n> entspricht.“ 162 \\nMit seinem klaren Eintreten für eine wissenschaftliche Weltsicht und\\ngegen religiöse Vorstellungen schuf Einstein wesentliche Grundlagen\\nfür das Konzept des Evolutionären Humanismus. 163 \\nAUSZEICHNUNGEN\\n Ehrenpromotionsurkunde, 1919 Einstein auf einer 5 Lirot-Banknote\\n(Israel, 1968) \\n     1909: Ehrendoktor der Universität Genf. 164 \\n      1914: Ordentliches Mitglied der Preußischen Akademie der\\nWissenschaften. 1933 erklärte Einstein seinen Austritt aus der\\nAkademie. 165 \\n      1915: Korrespondierendes Mitglied der Akademie der Wissenschaften\\nzu Göttingen (ab 1923 auswärtiges Mitglied). 166  1933 wurde\\nEinstein ausgeschlossen. 167 \\n      1917: Ehrenpreis der Peter-Wilhelm-Müller-Stiftung in der\\nKategorie Mathematik, gemeinsam mit David Hilbert.\\n      1919: Am 12.

    "## Defining allowed nodes\n",
    "Constraining the extracted graph structure can be highly beneficial, as it guides the model to focus on specific, relevant entities and relationships. By defining a clear schema, you improve consistency across extractions, making the outputs more predictable and aligned with the information you actually need. This reduces variability between runs and ensures that the extracted data follows a standardized structure, capturing expected information. With a well-defined schema, the model is less likely to overlook key details or introduce unexpected elements, resulting in cleaner, more usable graphs.\n",

    "With both nodes and relationships defined, our outputs become significantly more consistent. For example, Marie is always shown as winning an award, being the spouse of Pierre, and working at the University of Paris. However, since relationships are specified as a general list without restrictions on which nodes they can connect, some variation still occurs. For instance, the `FIELD_OF_RESEARCH` relationship might appear between a `Person` and a `ResearchField`, but sometimes it links an `Award` to a `ResearchField`. Additionally, since relationship directions aren't defined, there may be differences in directional consistency.\n",
    "To address the issues of not being able to specify which nodes a relationship can connect and enforcing relationship direction, we recently introduced a new option for defining relationships, as shown below."

While we invested considerable effort into prompt engineering, it's challenging to get LLM, especially the less performant one, to adhere to instructions with complete accuracy. To tackle this, we introduced a post-processing step, called strict_mode, that removes any information not conforming to the defined graph schema, ensuring cleaner and more consistent results.\n",
